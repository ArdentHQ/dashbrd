     * Command to update NFT activity records of a collection with calculated values
     *
     * This command updates the 'nft_activity' table by calculating and setting the 'total_native' and 'total_usd' columns based on the
     * values stored in the 'extra_attributes' column from the 'token_price_history' table. The
     * command performs the following actions:
     *
     * 1. For each record in 'nft_activity':
     *   - Extract the 'totalNative' value from the 'extra_attributes' JSON column and set it as 'total_native'.
     *   - Calculate 'total_usd' by multiplying 'total_native' with the 'ethereum' token price from 'token_price_history'
     *     for the time that activity happened.
     *
     * 2. Update is limited to records in 'nft_activity' associated with collections having a 'network_id' of 1 (Polygon in our app).
     *
     * 3. The command uses a SQL transaction to ensure data consistency. It commits the changes after successful execution.
     *
     * Caution: Before running this command, make sure to run `tokens:live-dump-price-history`.
