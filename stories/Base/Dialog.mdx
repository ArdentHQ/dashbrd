# Dialog

Dialog is a typical "modal" component. The component scaffolds transitions and base layout, but it's up to you to handle open/closed states and the content.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Dialog } from "@/Components/Dialog";

const [open, setOpen] = useState(true)

<Dialog
    title="Dialog Title"
    isOpen={open}
    onClose={() => setOpen(false)}
>
    Dialog body
</Dialog>
```

## Overriding initial focus

By default, the component will place focus on the X (close) button. That means that you can press Enter when modal is opened to close it immediately. You can override the initial focus by adding a `focus` prop with a ref to a focusable object. For example:

```jsx
import { Dialog } from "@/Components/Dialog";

const ref = useRef()

<Dialog focus={ref}>
    <input type="text" ref={ref} />
</Dialog>
```

## Static dialog

This is mostly paired with a Confirmation Dialog component, but sometimes you may wish to have a static dialog, or dialog you can't close. To accomplish this, add the `isStatic` property to the component and all "close" buttons are hidden and actions are dismissed.

```jsx
import { Dialog } from "@/Components/Dialog";

<Dialog
    title="Action required"
    isOpen={true}
    isStatic
>
    Please do something before progressing.
</Dialog>;
```
