# Internationalisation

All translation strings should be defined inside `php` files located in the `lang/{language}` directory, e.g. the english words and phrases commonly used throughout the app can be found at `lang/en/common.php`. A custom vite plugin is responsible for parsing the `php` files and generating `json` files which can be loaded and used by the frontend.

The downside of this approach is that in it's current form pluralization cannot be used. Plural forms need to be explicitly defined as standalone translation strings.

## Formatting

The keys used for the translations should all adhere to snake casing.

```php
// ✓ do

'welcome_friend' => 'Welcome Friend',

// ✗ don't

'welcomeFriend'  => 'Welcome Friend',
```

Interpolation can be achieved by using placeholders in the translation strings, which have to be prepended by a colon (`:`).

```php
'hello' => 'Hello :name',
```

## Usage

### Limitations

Currently pluralization does not work out of the box. This means that writing `:count comment|:count comments` will not produce a translation on the TypeScript end that can be used to switch between one and multiple instances. A card exists to bring pluralization to the TypeScript side through a helper method.

### PHP

Translations can be retrieved either through the `trans(key)` or `__(key)` helper methods, where the key corresponds to the translation string using dot syntax.

#### Without interpolation

```php
trans('messages.welcome_friend');
```

#### With interpolation

```php
trans('messages.hello', ['name' => 'friend']);
```

### Typescript

The frontend uses the `react-i18next` package and the `useTranslation()` hook it provides.

```ts
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";

const Component = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation();
  ...
};
```

#### Without interpolation

```ts
t("messages.welcome_friend");
```

#### With Interpolation

```ts
t("messages.hello", { name: "friend" });
```

#### Using as Parameter

When passing a translation as a parameter to a component, make sure you add `.toString()` at the end to pass a `string` along. For example:

```jsx
<Toast
    type="info"
    message={t("auth.wallet.connect_subtitle").toString()}
    isExpanded
    iconDimensions={{ width: 18, height: 18 }}
/>
```
