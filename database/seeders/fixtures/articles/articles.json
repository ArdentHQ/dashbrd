From Monday to Friday, we bring you some of our top picks from across the cryptosphere and serve it up to you in the most fun and entertaining way imaginable! Today we feature the world's most notorious activist collective.

However, much of the country's past is blood-soaked and characterized by significant amounts of human suffering. The Russian Revolution, the five-year plans for the development of the USSR under Stalin, the [Kyshtym Disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyshtym_disaster) (bet you didn't know about this one), the Chernobyl disaster (although this was actually Ukraine, it was once part of the USSR)...and that just spans the last few decades.\n\n<div style=\"width: 75%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SbWw39p.jpg)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\nUncle Joe, as he was affectionately known, was responsible for the deaths of millions of his own people\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nAfter the Cold War and the fall of communism, Boris Yeltsin became the first democratically elected leader of Russia in 1991. Eight years later, under immense pressure, Yeltsin resigned and chose [Vladimir Putin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin) as his successor. Putin served as President of Russia from 1999 to 2008 and reclaimed the position in 2012. In 2021, he still holds power. Putin has been criticized for silencing and imprisoning opponents, mismanaging the COVID-19 pandemic, vehemently opposing same-sex marriage and dismantling the rights of members of the LGBTQ+ community. As a result, many have come to see the Russian strongman as a tyrant hellbent on maintaining control and crushing dissident voices by any means necessary.\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JbLi6L6.jpg)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\nVladimir Putin, current President of the Russian Federation\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n## Straight Outta Russia\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/31pzb39/Pussy-Riot-by-Igor-Mukhin.jpg)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n<i>Pussy Riot circa 2012 (Photo credit: [Igor Mukhin](https://twitter.com/igormoukhin))</i>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nFebruary 21st, 2012\u2014Five women swaddled in long winter overcoats determinedly made their way into the [Cathedral of Christ the Saviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_Christ_the_Saviour) and ascended the pulpit. Situated along the Moscow River and just hundreds of meters from the Kremlin, this site is long considered the seat of the Russian Orthodoxy. Somewhat befitting this momentous event was the debut of [Tchaikovsky's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky) *1812 Overture* some 130 years earlier.\n\nCoats tossed aside revealing colorful clothing and donning their signature\u2014and potentially [cat pee stained](https://youtu.be/7xd0WlrSEik?t=2m40s)\u2014balaclavas, [Pussy Riot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pussy_Riot) set in motion a chain of events that would lead to their imprisonment and cement them as champions of free speech.\n\nWhile dancing and singing 'Mother Mary, drive Putin away,' the five were promptly bum-rushed and escorted from the pulpit. Their 'Punk Prayer' was viewed by many as a direct attack on the Orthodox Church. [Reportedly](https://www.levada.ru/sites/default/files/2012_eng.pdf), only about 19% of Russians saw this performance as a protest against Pres. [Vladimir Putin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin) at the time.\n\nThree of the five were ultimately arrested and charged with 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred,' denied bail, and held for more than four months without a court hearing. They were subsequently sentenced to two years imprisonment in a women's labor camp.\n\n![](youtube:PN5inCayfnM)\n\nSince their release at the end of 2013, *Pussy Riot* has toured around the world and performed at major festivals including Glastonbury, Roskilde, Sziget, Riot Fest, Rock al Parque, Banksy's Dismaland, Nova Rock, and Festival of Dangerous Ideas at [The Sydney Opera House](https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/). Their favorite topics are gender fluidity, feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, decentralization and anti-authoritarianism and politics of self. *Pussy Riot* served as grand marshals of Toronto gay pride, and performed at Prides in Los Angeles, New York, Vienna, Stockholm, Boston, and so on.\n\n> 'Feminist, explicitly anti-Putin, protesting the banning of gay pride and the Orthodox church\u2019s support of the president...symbol of defiance in the face of freedoms lost.' - Guardian named *Pussy Riot* among the best art of the 21st century\n\n## _'This eth goes directly to buying gasoline'_\n\n[Pu$$y Riot NFTs](https://pussyriot.love) is a collection of 333 NFTs on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) Blockchain. This collection entitled *Virgin Mary, Please Become A Feminist,* features *Pussy Riot's* hand-drawn artwork overlaid across a digitized copy of Nadia's 2012 prison sentencing documents and is inspired by their shared love for rebellion, plants, cows, and psychedelics. Also featured are several collaborations with NFT artist [Trippy](https://twitter.com/NFTrippy).

        "body": "Join us as we take a look at our Discovery of the Day! Whether its their art, their exciting communities, or the unique things planned in their projects, there is definitely something here to grab your interest. Today we are taking a look at Luchadores NFTs. \n\n## Luchadores Leaving a Legacy \nOne of the most concerning things about a lot of the popular NFTs we see today is preservation. Will they exist a few years from now or will they point to broken links? It is a large problem and one that many newcomers to the NFT space seem to be unaware of as they continue expanding their collections. \n\nThis is something that Luchadores aimed to solve when they created their collection. Instead of pre-generated NFTs, Luchadores are randomly generiated at the time of purchase using Chainlink VRF. Chainlink VRF or Verificable Random Function is a provably-fair and verificable source of randomness designed for smart contracts. \n\nTherefore, not only are Luchadores randomly generated at the time of purchase, but the art and associated metadata are stored on the Ethereum blockchain. \n\nThese cute little wrestlers are 24x24 SVG art that can scale to any size. There are millions of possible combinations and only 10,000 of them will ever be minted. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AQph76a.png)\n\nFor the fun of it, I minted two luchadors - *Say hello to El Toro and Javier.*\n\n\n## The Path to Glory\n\nThe roadmap for Luchadores is a little bit different from what we've been seeing as of late. The main roadmap item they are working on is the Lucha Arena. The Lucha Arena will be a turn-based combat game where all game mechanics will be on-chain. Players will be able to choose their fighting style and manage their stable of Luchadores. \n\nAfter the initial 10,000 Luchadores have been minted, the team will introduce a Prodigy System. This system will allow players to generate new luchas to sell or grow their tag teams for the Lucha Arena. \n\nOne roadmap item which is availale now is the ability to choose a unique and permanent name for your Luchador. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8PZZHc3.png)\n\n***Long live El Toro!***\n\n\n## Stats\n* Total Items: 10,000\n* Owners: 642\n* Floor Price: .01 ETH\n* Volume Traded: 1.3 ETH\n\nAt the time of this writing, Luchadores are still avaiable to mint on their [official website](https://luchadores.io/). You can also snag some from their store on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/luchadores-io).\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com\n) and don\u2019t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).*\n\nWe will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord](https://MSQ.io/discord) every Tuesday and Friday at 3PM EST.

        "slug": "get-protocol-is-our-project-of-the-month-september-2021",
        "body": "**MSQ is the new homepage for the decentralized web, and as such, we have plenty of great projects that have already joined us. From Blockchain games and DeFi protocols to NFTs and entire ecosystems, MSQ has it all. Every month we highlight some of the best performing projects and show them some much-deserved love. GET Protocol is a digital Non-Fungible Token (NFT) ticketing platform that has gone from strength to strength over the last few years. We are proud to put them under the spotlight and celebrate their achievement as our Project of the Month!**\n\n## Out With the Old\n\nEvent Management is a massive industry that requires extensive planning and a careful approach to logistics. Traditional ticketing systems give attendees access to a particular venue and sometimes extend premium benefits depending on the grade of ticket they hold. The problem with these systems is that they're often impersonal, inefficient, costly, slow, and don't allow many customizations. In addition, organizers also lose a substantial percentage of their profits to third-party intermediaries.\n\nIn stark contrast, GET Protocol has created a Blockchain-based system that completely reimagines event ticketing.\n\n## The Future of Ticketing\n\nEstablished in 2016, GET Protocol has stuck by its ethos of making Blockchain as hassle-free and easy-to-use as possible. In continuing this vision, they have just launched a new website and content hub, updated DAO-friendly tokenomics, and an exciting new product called *The Digital Twin.*\n\n![](youtube:cjXSeElvbss)\n\n> Check out this informative video explaining GET Protocol\n\n### The Digital Twin\n\n*The Digital Twin* is an extension of GET Protocol\u2019s mission to better serve end-users and clients alike. It allows existing ticketers to greatly benefit from the potential of NFT tickets and Blockchain with none of the difficulties or complexity associated with Blockchain technology.\n\nEvery ticket is integrated with an NFT copy on the Polygon Blockchain, greatly expanding the potential for new and innovative revenue streams and engagement avenues by allowing providers to capture secondary market value and letting attendees collect digital goods.\n\nAccording to GET Protocol, '*The Digital Twin* can be integrated in less than a week and has zero operation risk to existing business operations - meaning existing ticketing companies can give *the Digital Twin* a try to see how NFT tickets can benefit their ticketing and open up new possibilities for their event organizer clients.'\n\n> *The Digital Twin* extends the life cycle of a ticket, packing new utility into each and every one. Gone are the days of tickets being a single-use asset\n\nGET Protocol also announced their launch integrator, [Yourticketprovider.nl](https://yourticketprovider.nl), a Netherlands-based ticketing issuer well-known for looking beyond the QR code and providing over 2 million tickets a year.\n\n### New Website & Content Hub\n\nGET Protocol launched a brand new website to reflect the scale of their broad infrastructure offered to both existing and new ticketing companies. Their *White-Label* product allows new ticketing companies to get up and running from scratch and existing enterprises to benefit from NFT ticketing.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qdpbCWV.png)\n\nTheir new website also breaks down the complexity of GET Protocol, providing a look at their products and the benefits offered. The content hub showcases industry trends and insights from the global ticketing industry, customer stories, and release information, while their revamped documentation is ideal for developers and those seeking to understand the internal systems that comprise GET Protocol.\n\n### Tokenomics\n\nGET Protocol also updated its tokenomics model to provide scalable ticketing solutions to global audiences by allowing all transactional activity to be on-chain, verifiable, and transparent. *Digital Twin* integrators and *White-Label* only need to top up using the ticketing dashboard to take advantage of GET Protocol's infrastructure. This can even be carried out using traditional fiat payment methods where all the complexity of cryptocurrency is handled in the background.\n\n> 'We believe being able to see value flow through GET Protocol is imperative to the end goal of transitioning to a DAO that is governed by ticketing companies, big and small as well as Blockchain community members who hold GET.'\n\nWe are honored to have GET Protocol as a partner on MSQ and congratulate them as our Project of the Month! The number of contributions they have made to the cryptosphere continues to grow, and we have no doubt that they will succeed in totally transforming the way the ticketing industry operates.",

        "body": "**When we started the process of looking for projects that had an interest in MSQ's vision, we came across the Hive community. To say that the Hive ecosystem is active would be an understatement. They are highly engaged on multiple projects, dapps, and community initiatives. We are proud to have them as a partner on MSQ and want to highlight the immense amount of projects from Hive joining us on MSQ!**\n\n## Collaborating with Hive\n\nHive is a large ecosystem with a wide variety of dapps, projects, and use cases. In order to get a good understanding of how it works, we connected directly with the team at Hive. They have been instrumental in connecting us with a multitude of projects and shaping what would eventually become the Hive Hub.\n\n> [Check out the Hive Hub](/hubs/hive)\n\nHive joining us on MSQ is only the first step. As time goes one we hope to see them fully embrace the platform and its features in order to shine a spotlight on everything they are creating.\n\n## Hive Projects You Can Find on MSQ\n\n## Games\n\nWhen it comes to games on Hive, there is an abundance of titles to choose from. Each game has their own vibrant community and innovates on blockchain features in unique ways.\n\n***Splinterlands*** -  a digital, collectible card game built on blockchain technology. It is similar in concept to games like Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone where you build up a collection of cards, which have various stats and abilities to use them to battle other players in skill-based matches.\n\n***Rising Star*** - a card-based RPG where you work your way up from street musician to global megastar. The game has you doing everything on your path to stardom, from completing missions all the way to unlocking permanent fans in the form of collectible NFTs. The most intriguing thing about Rising Star, besides all of the care and thought that went into the game mechanics, is the ability for players to own their in-game assets. NFTs and special cards unlocked during playthroughs can be sold within the in-game marketplace. Blockchain and gaming open the door to a multitude of different possibilities for gamers and Rising Star does a great job highlighting these aspects.\n\n***CryptoBrewMaster*** - lets players set out to collect ingredients, upgrade their brewery, and craft their own beer! The main purpose behind CryptoBrewMaster is to create a game that is not only fun but teaches aspiring craft beer brewers the ins-and-outs of beer production. The game takes a technical approach to brewing in regards to how players need to collect the correct equipment and design a recipe prior to creating their beer. In furtherance of their main purpose, CryptoBrewMaster also partners with different breweries, equipment manufacturers and suppliers in order to connect aspiring brewers with reputable businesses from all around the world!\n\n***Rabona*** - a massive multiplayer online soccer management simulator. Players decide how to build and develop their team, take on the role of the head coach, and manage the financials of their club. Lead your club to the top of the league and become League Champion in a game that embraces all areas of team management.\n\n\n## Health\n\nWhen it comes to your health, making the right choices and creating a positive lifestyle should not seem like a chore. Dapps like Actifit on Hive reward users for their everyday activity and transforms your exercise into a fun and interactive experience.\n\n***Actifit*** - an innovative social dApp that incentivizes a healthy lifestyle by rewarding your everyday activity. The Actifit mobile app tracks user activity and rewards users with AFIT tokens, Actifit innate token, but also HIVE, STEEM, and SPORTS token rewards on supported blockchains and partner communities. Users can sync their activity count using various fitness trackers including Fitbit and Apple Watch.\n\n## Social Media\n\nWhen it comes to social media on Hive, all platforms take a strong stance on providing their users with an open, censorship-resistant space to share their thoughts. In addition, many projects reward content creators with Hive or Hive-based tokens for their content. Take a look at the different platforms and dapps below!\n\n***Dapplr*** - the first design-based app that lets you be a part of the Hive Ecosystem. \u201cDapplr\u201d is derived from the word dapple, meaning spots/patches of light or color. The design language that the dapplr team has chosen for their application is subtly explained by the name - prioritizing just a few colors and a fun aesthetic to the overall user-experience. The Dapplr team believes that details matter and that can be seen in the colorful liquid-like effects underpinning the enitre application.\n\n***D.Buzz*** - a micro-blogging platform that allows users to create accounts, join in on conversations and post their own content. The team behind D.Buzz was originally on Steem but moved over to the Hive Blockchain during the community hardfork in early 2020. D.Buzz\u2019s mission is to promote freedom of speech and user-rights. By creating a platform that is a decentralized social-media alternative, D.Buzz supports a censorship-resistant platform where users are in control.\n\n***3Speak*** - is a place where content creators directly own their onsite assets and their communities. This platform runs specifically on the Hive blockchain and facilitates a censorship-free environment where content creators can express their views. By using 3Speak, users are rewarded in Hive tokens and can receive donations via the 3Speak token just by using the platform. These tokens act not only as rewards but as governance tokens as well where holders have a voice in the direction of 3Speak.\n\n***Eccency*** - a decentralized open-source social network built and powered by users. Ecency promotes community-building and empowering content creators through rewards on their blogging platform. By being a content creator on Ecency you can earn cryptocurrency, which is rewarded to all users for various social activities they perform on Ecency.com as well as the Ecency Mobile and Desktop applications. Additionally, Ecency\u2019s users can also earn Ecency Points by referring their friends to the platform.\n\n***PeakD*** - a community platform built on Hive that allows users to post their content and exercise true ownership over their content. Decentralization and censorship resistant tech aren\u2019t just buzzwords, censorship resistance and decentralization is baked into blockchains like Hive. Many platforms will say that censorship-resistance and free speech is part of their ideology or company vision. However, when these ideals get tested, companies can be quick to change their policies. On PeakD, decentralization means that users own their content and can use the tools that PeakD has to offer in a manner that they see fit. Touted as Hive\u2019s entry point to the decentralized web, they place a high value on users having true ownership over their content, which can be seen in the way their platform is structured.\n\n***Aureal*** - a decentralized podcast platform built on top of Hive. Aureal acts as a bridge between traditional audio content creators (podcasters) and consumers by connecting them to Web 3.0. The team at Aureal aims to solve the everlasting and painful problem of podcast monetization and discovery without using advertisements. More importantly, the team strives to provide content creators with all the necessary tools they may require.\n\n## Payments\n\nWhen it comes to payments, the Hive ecosystem is constantly coming up with new ways to have merchants and business owners transact on the Hive Blockchain.\n\n***Hive Pay*** - a merchant solution that allows merchants and vendors to easily accept payments in Hive and Hive-engine tokens. With a few simple lines of code, a merchant can add a Hive Pay button to their checkout pages.\n\n## Developer Resources/Tools\n\nIn order to succeed and innovate within any ecosystem, developer tools and resources are of the uptmost importance. Take a look at some of Hive's development-focused offerings.\n\n***FullAlt*** - a team of passionate developers from the Hive Ecosystem that are creating products for the benefit of Hive and its growing community. One of their most widely used products is HiveTips. HiveTips allows people to tip any user HIVE tokens on various social platforms.\n\n***DLUX*** - an open-source project built on the Hive blockchain that started as a way for users to build, post and monetize virtual reality experiences without needing to know any code themselves. By leveraging networked A-Frame, visitor avatars spawn into social VR rooms with interconnecting portals to other places, all in-browser across mobile, headsets and desktop computers. With full Hive wallet integration, the ability to purchase and tip became a reality for VR art galleries, augmented reality menu systems and 2D web dApps.\n\n## NFTs\nNFTs or Non-fungible tokens have become an increasingly popular usecase for blockchain technology in recent months. They can be used in a wide variety of areas such as art, gaming, real-estate, and more. In addition to the games featured on Hive's ecosystem, let's look at a specific dapp specifically for artists.\n\n***Hive Showroom*** - a digital art marketplace built on the Hive blockchain. NFT Showroom runs on Hive Engine which is a smart contracts side-chain platform for the Hive blockchain. Their on-site currency is SWAP.HIVE which is a token that is pegged 1:1 with Hive. The minting fee to tokenize 1 edition is 5 Hive plus 1 Hive for each extra edition. They charge a 10% market fee for each sale, for secondary sales artists receive a 5% royalty. NFT Showroom aims to provide a platform that is easy to use and less expensive to transact for both the creator and collector and solve existing problems in the crypto art sphere.\n\n## Events\nNetworking and meeting new people is more crucial today than it has ever been. While more and more people are working remotely, the time we can  get together is even more valuable. Let's look at a virtual event put on by our Hive Partner - Splinterlands.\n\n***DYGYCON*** - a new kind of digital conference event built with web 3.0 in mind. Powered by Gamerjibe Social, the gamified expo that hosts DYGYCON will supercharge your networking skills. Your avatar can run, jump, double jump (yes you heard us right), attend presentations, or step up to a private conversation table with a new friend for a quick impromptu meeting.

        "body": "***Join us as we bring you another epic Discovery of the Day! There's an entire universe of projects to check out in the wider cryptoverse, and we're doing our best to bring you some of the most promising ones around! If it has a great community, amazing developers and some awesome features, then we want to know about it! Without further ado, today we present: Solana Bananas!***\n\n## A Banana Republic?\n\nDictators, despots, authoritarians, tyrants...call 'em whatever you want, but there have been a bunch of 'em over the years. Those that presided over economies that depended almost exclusively on the exportation of agricultural goods, particularly coffee or bananas, were the undisputed leaders of what became known as *Banana Republics.* Yes, trouble in paradise, [Far Cry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Cry_(video_game)) 1 without the trigens, tropical travesties\u2014you get the idea.\n\nWhat does this have to do with our Discovery of the Day? Everything and nothing of course. [Solana Bananas](https://solanabananas.com/) is an NFT collection of 1,500 flavorsome fruits hanging in the plantations of the [Solana](https://solana.com/) Blockchain. Each of these entirely unique bananas is algorithmically generated and stored with proof of ownership on Solana's fast, efficient and secure Blockchain. As an added bonus, when a user mints a Solana Banana, they will have the chance to mint an ultra rare Banana like the treasured *Golden Banana*, or a *Zombie Banana*.\n\nEvery Banana is made up from over 130 different attributes including background color, facial expression, hairstyle, eyewear, skin color, apparel, clothing and so on. Certain attributes are rarer than others, but regardless of what a user receives, there will only ever be 1,500 Solana Bananas.\n\nSolana Bananas wants to give back to the world, which is exactly why 10% of all proceeds will go directly towards the [Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund](https://gorillafund.org/). As an organization that protects critically endangered mountain gorillas through research, training, community outreach, and constant on-the-ground presence in Rwanda, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund needs sufficient support to ensure their work is carried out unimpeded. Solana Bananas believe this cause to be very much aligned with their values and the theme behind their lively NFT project.\n\nAnd now let's take a look at some of these brilliant Bananas up-close:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ob8Nd3x.png)\n\n> Snake Banana Skin is here to chew gum and retain his ripeness...and he's all outta ripeness\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XhnHpuq.png)\n\n> Hours in the Miami sun left Bert Banana feeling uncharacteristically red\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jTv6C4D.png)\n\n> Bullish Blue Banana brazenly binges barbital brands\n\n## Ba Na Na Naaaaa...Ba Na Na Naaaaa (It's Beethoven)\n\nForgive the onomatopoeia, it's nearly impossible for me to write such a Potassium-rich post like this without making a pun or two. So the Solana Bananas Roadmap (which you can also view in their [Discord](https://discord.gg/hMQPFTZ2)) is detailed below for your convenience. Q3 of 2021 has come and gone, but it seems like there's a fair amount planned for the coming months and all the way into the second quarter of 2022. Very nice stuff. Anyway, see for yourself:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kK9nHPP.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sDl3AAV.png)\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that, unlike many other projects that feature several thousand generative NFTs, Solana Bananas is limited to a mere 1,500. This means fewer owners, greater rarity and, if all goes according to plan, higher value as the months and years roll by. From what I can tell, the project is moving along at a healthy pace and has a suitably strong community behind it.\n\n## Stats\n\nSolana Bananas is currently sold out, so if you want to pick one up, you'll need to head over to their [Solanart page](https://solanart.io/collections/solanabananas) and buy one there. Now how about some stats?\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\n\n- **Total Items** - 264/1,500\n- **Total Owners** - 196\n\nWell, what can I tell you? Solana Bananas is a delightfully quirky NFT project with some fun features and a unique approach within the ever-expanding world of Non-Fungible Tokens. Be sure to check out their [website](https://solanabananas.com/), follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SolanaBananas) and join their [Discord](https://discord.gg/hMQPFTZ2) for all the latest news from the bunch (I can't help myself, OK?)

        "slug": "el-salvadors-love-affair-with-bitcoin",
        "body": "***El Salvador is the first country in the world to make Bitcoin legal. Will this be the answer to the nation's financial woes? Or will it be a match made in hell? Let's find out more!***\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NuAfM27.png)\n\n## The Beginnings of a Financial Romance\n\nUnless you've been living under a rock for the last while, you must have heard that El Salvador recently passed a bill to make [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) legal tender. In fact, the bill was passed by a large majority, gaining [62 out of 84 possible votes](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/el-salvador-approves-first-law-bitcoin-legal-tender-2021-06-09//) within Congress. Under the new law, which will be implemented in September 2021, Bitcoin must be accepted by firms when offered as payment for goods and services. Tax contributions can also be paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, El Salvador is not getting rid of the US Dollar all together. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele stated:\n\n> *'The use of Bitcoin will be optional, nobody will receive Bitcoin if they don't want it. If someone receives a payment in Bitcoin, they can choose to automatically receive it in Dollars'*\n\nEl Salvador is the first country in the world to make Bitcoin legit. You might be wondering why this is such a big deal for El Salvador as well as several other Central and Latin American countries. Let me explain by first giving you some history on the nation that is El Salvador.\n\nThis small Central American country's past is a troubled one. It has endured political and economic instability with a series of coups, revolts, and a succession of authoritarian rulers. Persistent socioeconomic inequality and civil unrest led to the [Salvadoran Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvadoran_Civil_War) which took place between 1979 and 1992. Due to this constant state of conflict, El Salvador has been ravaged by poverty and gang-related criminality.\n\nTraditionally, El Salvador relied heavily on coffee exports for revenue. However, they later looked to diversify their international exports and the economy by opening up trade and financial links as well as expanding their manufacturing sector. To facilitate trade and attract foreign investment, El Salvador dropped its own currency, the Colon, in 2001 and adopted the US Dollar.\n\nSo what has all of this got to do with Bitcoin? Well, simply put, adopting the US Dollar didn't solve El Salvador's financial problems. The foreign trade that was promised, the high-quality jobs, the foreign investment, the increase in exports...all of this didn't come to pass. So how does El Salvador keep its financial head above water?\n\nForeign remittances is the answer. In 2019, foreign remittances amounted to [$5.65 billion](https://ticotimes.net/2021/01/04/el-salvador-marks-20-years-of-dollarization-with-weak-economic-impulse/), equivalent to 16% of the country's GDP. Many Salvadorans migrate to the United States to find work so they can send money home to their families, and foreign remittances allow them to accomplish this.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CxK2PN7.jpg)\n\nNaturally, this is where Bitcoin comes in. Now as many of you know, sending money through the traditional banking system is slow and expensive, because everyone wants a slice of the pie. Moreover, opening a bank account requires legal documents, like a passport. This is a major issue in developing countries where accessing official documents is typically expensive, time-consuming and complicated.\n\nBank accounts...now that's another problem! According to President Bukele: \n\n> *'Some 70% of people in El Salvador lack access to traditional financial services.'*\n\nSo, with such a large percentage of the population unbanked, Bitcoin could solve a lot of problems by getting money from abroad, quickly and far more affordably.\n\n## Not Quite a Fairytale?\n\nMany arguments have been put forward criticizing El Salvador's decision to make Bitcoin legal tender. The [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Home) and [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home) have outright refused to assist with the roll-out. The World Bank cited that they had problems with the [transparency](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57507386/) of Bitcoin transactions and the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining.\n\nExcuse me? Did they not hear President Bukele say that El Savador will mine Bitcoin using geothermal power from the country's volcanoes?\n\n> More on that in a follow-up article. Stay tuned!\n\nOne common argument is that using Bitcoin is too difficult and risky for the average person. To address this issue, President Bukele has committed to offering training to people and initiatives promoting the use of Bitcoin.\n\nHe is also launching an e-wallet called Chivo, which is Salvadoran slang for 'cool.' As part of the package, people who make use of it will receive $30 in Bitcoin so that adoption is incentivized.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PgSkFU1.png)\n\n[Athena Bitcoin](https://www.athenabitcoin.com/) announced plans to install 1,500 Bitcoin ATMs in El Salvador, targeting places where residents receive remittances from abroad. This should make it easier for people to buy and sell Bitcoin.\n\nPresident Bukele was asked whether the use of Bitcoin would encourage criminal activity and money laundering. This is a common argument often used by opponents of crypto and Blockchain. He replied that criminals are already using the Dollar...\n\n> *'The problem is not the Dollar, it is the criminals.'*\n\nAnother argument is that Bitcoin is highly volatile, which makes it risky. However, with rampant inflation across many Central and Latin American countries, the volatility of Bitcoin doesn't hold a candle to the levels of inflation these nations have endured. For example, Argentina is battling an unsustainable debt load while Venezuela\u2019s economy has shrunk by 75% since 2013. Nice job fiat currencies!\n\nDissenters have often said that Bitcoin transactions are slow and expensive. Slow? I'm not so sure about that. I've personally had to wait longer than 10 days for money to arrive in my bank account from abroad. In my opinion, Bitcoin is definitely the hare while banks are more like the old arthritic tortoise...\n\nAlso, don't forget Jack Mallers' [Strike app](https://strike.me/) and the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/). The Strike app makes it fast and cheap to send and receive small amounts of Bitcoin. This is because Strike is powered by the Lightning Network, a layer 2 protocol that settles transactions 'off-chain' through a growing network of user-hosted channels and nodes. In fact, the Strike app has quickly become the most popular one in El Salvador.\n\n![](twitter:DocumentingBTC/status/1394393371431538695)\n\nExpensive? Start looking at organizations like [Western Union](https://www.westernunion.com/) and [MoneyGram](https://www.westernunion.com/)...the fee system is mind-boggling! Fees differ depending on where you're sending your money, whether you're using a bank transfer or a credit card, or even whether your recipient is receiving the money as cash or into a bank account. Also, one time a relative sent me some money via Western Union, I had to show my passport to prove my identity. So as it stands, the use of personal documentation is necessary to transact in the legacy financial system.\n\n## Making It Together\n\nWhether other Central and Latin American countries follow El Salvador's lead and make Bitcoin legal tender remains to be seen. The reaction of the IMF and The World Bank is certainly something to take into account. Do they really believe Bitcoin is too risky and simply don't want to be associated with it? Or do they see Bitcoin as a threat to the financial status quo and therefore their power and influence? Hmmm...\n\nIn my opinion, anything that shakes up the traditional financial system is only a good thing. Whatver happens, you can be sure that I'll be bringing you all the latest updates on El Salvador and Bitcoin as they occur.

Yup, whether it's the poetic works of Romantics like [Percy Bysshe Shelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley) (who wrote my favorite poem, [Ozymandias](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias) and was married to [Mary Shelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley), author of [Frankenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein)) or the dour narratives of authors like [Aldous Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley), I can tell you all about that...but not today.\n\nNaturally, that's more the literary side of English. Then there's the language aspect to consider. Now something you may or may not know is the **9 Parts of Speech**. They are:\n\n> 1. Articles - **a/an** *(indefinite)* and the *(definite)*\n> 2. Interjections - **Wow!**, **Oh!**, **Woah!**, **Yikes!** and so on\n> 3. Prepositions - **at**, **in**, **upon**, **beneath**, **within**, **outside**, **on top** and so on\n> 4. Conjunctions - **so**, **because**, **then**, **yet**, **but**, **and**, **or** and so on\n> 5. Adverbs - **longingly**, **quickly**, **eagerly**, **lazily** and so on\n> 6. Verbs - **dodge**, **dip**, **duck**, **dive**, and...[**dodge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ASBsQfXnw)\n> 7. Adjectives - **coarse**, **strong**, **red**, **terrific** and so on\n> 8. Pronouns - **he**, **they**, **she**, **him**, **it**, **them** and so on\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ehltRi2.gif)\n\n> Patches O'Houlihan knows his stuff!\n\nSo what's the last Part of Speech you ask? Why, it's the big kahuna of the English language (and maybe every language for that matter). The subject, the object, the idea, the place...\n\n## Nouns\n\nThere are many, many nouns in the English language, but something tells me that in the not-too-distant future, [Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/), 'an experimental attempt to improve the formation of on-chain avatar communities,' may one day dwarf this number if what they say is indeed factual. In many respects, Nouns builds on the model established by legendary NFT project [Cryptopunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) in that it attempts to bootstrap identity, community, governance and a treasury that can be accessed and used by the community itself.\n\nSo how does it all work? Well, here's a rundown of the mechanics that underpin Nouns:\n\n- All Nouns artwork is in the public domain\n- One (1) Noun is trustlessly auctioned forever on an indefinite basis\n- 100% of the proceeds from Nouns auctions are trustlessly sent to the Nouns DAO treasury\n- Once an auction has been settled, the next begins immediately\n- Every single Noun is a member of Nouns DAO\n- The Nouns DAO uses a fork of [Compound Governance](https://compound.finance/governance)\n- 1 Noun = 1 Vote\n- The treasury is controlled exclusively by Nouns via governance\n- The artwork is generative and stored directly on-chain rather than [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)\n- There are *no explicit rules* for attribute scarcity, all Nouns are equally rare\n- 'Nounders' receive rewards in the form of Nouns (10% of supply for the first 5 years)\n\nWith regards to the creation of Nouns, they are generated randomly based on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) block hashes. No 'if' statements or any other rules serve to govern Noun scarcity, meaning that all Nouns are equally rare. At time of writing, Nouns are generated from 2 different backgrounds, 30 different body types, 137 accessories, 234 distinct heads, and 21 different kinds of glasses.\n\n> If you would like to experiment with off-chain Noun generation, you may do so via the [Nouns Playground](https://nouns.wtf/playground)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aggg7cG.png)\n\n### Nouns DAO\n\nThe Nouns DAO makes of a fork of Compound Governance and functions as the main means by which governance occurs within the Nouns ecosystem. As aforementioned, 100% of all ETH proceeds from daily Noun auctions go directly towards the Nouns DAO treasury. Each and every Noun is a permanent member of Nouns DAO and is therefore entitled to one vote in all matters concerning governance. Noun votes cannot be transferred, meaning that if a Noun is sold, the vote goes long with it. However, they can be delegated, meaning that your vote can be assigned to someone else as long as you retain ownership of your Noun.\n\nOf course you must be wondering what a Noun looks like up close (unless you've seen one before of course). Fear not, here's a few Nouns I generated using the Noun Playground:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iD8KHw4.png)\n\n> This colorful trashcan is inclusive and open-minded...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Y8RXASC.png)\n\n> Strawberry, meet Moon. Oh, and don't forget your life jacket!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RlFZ7vD.png)\n\n> 0_0\n\n## On-Chain Artwork\n\nAll Nouns are stored directly on the Ethereum Blockchain and do not make use of pointers to other networks such as IPFS. The reason for this is because Noun parts are compressed and stored on-chain through the use of a custom run-length encoding (RLE) which is a kind of lossless compression.\n\nThe compressed parts are efficiently converted into a single base64 encoded SVG image on-chain. To achieve this, each individual part is decoded into an intermediate format before being converted into a series of SVG rects using batched, on-chain string concatenation. Upon generating the entire SVG, it is subsequently base64 encoded.\n\nIf you didn't really understand that, don't worry...all you need to know is that Nouns are all unique and stored directly on Ethereum.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pWV3yV4.gif)\n\n## Nounder's Reward\n\n'Nounders' consists of the ten builders that brought Nouns to life. Herewith their Twitter tags:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0HSfzTI.png)\n\nSince all the funds received from Noun auctions go towards the Nouns DAO, the Nounders decided to compensate themselves with Nouns. Every tenth Noun for the first five years of the project (Nouns designated #0, #10, #20, #30 and so on) will be automatically sent to the Nounder's multisig so that they may be vested and shared among the founding members of the project.\n\n> An important note: Nounder distributions don't interfere with the cadence of 24 hour auctions. Again, Nouns are sent directly to the Nounder's multisig, and auctions continue according to schedule with the next available Noun ID.\n\n## SharkDAO\n\n[SharkDAO](https://sharkdao.community/) actually started out as a group of strangers from the internet that wanted to pool their resources together and acquire Nouns. Since the DAO began on August 9th 2021, SharkDao has acquired a total of 5 Nouns, brought together over 400 sharks and raised close to 1,000 ETH. As their official website states, they exist to 'evolve the Web3 ecosystem.'\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Sf1aOMa.png)\n\n> The Basics of how SharkDAO works\n\nYou can learn more about becoming a member of SharkDAO by joining their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/8aThDGXHqH) and following them on [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/sharkdao)\n\n## Proper Nouns\n\nAs you can tell, Nouns is a serious project that is here for the long haul. Feel free to follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nounsdao) and join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/nouns) so that you can stay informed regarding the project's progress and get to know the wider Nouns community a little better!\n\nThat wraps up this Discovery of the Day.

Now this person is responsible for creating completely code generated NFT profile picture collections with ***'No designer, just code.'*** Wild, right?\n\nThus far, thedude has created several PFP collections using his creative approach: [the dudes](https://opensea.io/collection/thedudes), [the duds](https://opensea.io/collection/theduds), [the abstract dudes](https://opensea.io/collection/the-abstract-dudes) and [the dudes factory](https://opensea.io/collection/the-dudes-factory).\n\nAll of this has been created by one person (yup, thedude) who has been coding interactive web apps since he was 15! So it seems he's always had a knack for this stuff, and it's very clear that he's...one busy dude!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nE2JWoK.gif)\n\n> When in doubt... [just play it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) cool\n\n### the dudes, the duds & the abstract duds\n\n[the dudes](https://opensea.io/collection/thedudes) is the first interactive fully code generated NFT collection to appear on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. In essence, the dudes is the genesis collection of the overall project. And don't forget\u2014no designer worked on this...it's nothing more than a few lines of code that generates random ugly dudes (they're not ugly actually, they're kinda sweet and endearing!)\n\nAll traits are assigned inside the smart contract itself while each rarity score is defined on the chain. There are a total of 21,600 unique dudes, but only 512 will ever be made available to claim. That...isn't a whole lot. If anything, that means the dudes are extremely rare, so owning one really is something special!\n\nWhen I first saw these guys, I couldn't believe they were the random product of some algorithm! It's quite bizarre to say the least, and of course, very impressive as well! Feast your eyes on some of these 'ugly' dudes below *(also, can we have a word count for how many times I've mentioned the word 'dude' in this article!?)*\n\n![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/fU3HRbk.png)\n\n> the dudes\n\nNext up we have ['the duds.'](https://opensea.io/collection/theduds) Now these guys were airdropped by the creator of 'the dudes.' The intriguing part about this collection is that they slowly reveal themselves as time passes. After 07/28/2022, they will show their faces fully. Take a look at their current state below \ud83d\udc40\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GfFxqYv.png)\n\n> the duds\n\nAnd finally we have ['the abstract dudes'](https://opensea.io/collection/the-abstract-dudes) which are derivatives of the original ['the dudes'](https://opensea.io/collection/thedudes) and well...it's in the name! They look super abstract! The original 'the dudes' smart contract was used to create these pieces. This collection served as the proof of concept that revealed the potential possibilities of harnessing the dudes' DNA.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6tEIDCm.png)\n\n> the abstract dudes\n\nOne aspect that makes this project truly special is that every single NFT is interactive. If you visit the dudes' [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/thedudes) page, you can click on any dude to 'agitate' it, or you can move your mouse around and watch its gaze follow your cursor. Now that's some really funky stuff!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TWrelYb.gif)\n\n### the pixels\n\nNow let's move on to thedude's latest endeavor: the pixels. This collection consists of 5,120 'the pixels' that live on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain. A unique element of the pixels is that they constantly change and evolve\u2014this is possible because the traits are embedded into the smart contract, allowing it to delegate other contracts to manipulate each pixel.\n\nThe contract has a feature enabled called 'the pixel inc,' granting the NFTs the ability to adopt different traits for special occasions such as Halloween and Christmas. I swear, each project made by thedude just gets cooler and cooler! Kudos for the totally genius innovation...whoever you are!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kw1vnVD.gif)\n\n> the pixels\n\n### the dudes DAO\n\nWe've established that the dudes are awesome, but do you want to know something that's even *more* awesome? Everyone who owns one of these NFTs from any one of these collections is part of something bigger: **'our dudes DAO.'**\n\n100% of all existing royalties are owned by the DAO. Its primary role is a simple one\u2014to encourage the growth of the dudes brand and project as a whole.\n\n> A decentralized autonomous organization is an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government.\n\n## the dudes roadmap\n\nthe dudes project is actually split into two separate roadmaps: the Dude development roadmap, and the Community development roadmap.\n\nThe Dude roadmap focuses on airdrops, collaborations with other projects, staking and more. You can view the collaborations that the dudes have engaged in so far via [the dudes factory](https://opensea.io/collection/the-dudes-factory)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QRnekpt.png)\n\n> 'Our dude development roadmap is centered around delivering project value to our holders...'\n\nNow the Community roadmap is a little different\u2014simply put, the DAO votes on suggestions provided by the community via the shared Trello board, which can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/invite/b/SilI1mJf/3017d49963aeb65364dd8a81d42442d2/dude-owners-community-board)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oh9bSY6.png)\n\n## the dudes statistics\n\nUnfortunately all of the collections we have showcased today are sold out \ud83d\ude2d But not to worry! You can still grab yourself one of these unique interactive NFTs on the dudes' various OpenSea pages:\n\n* [the dudes](https://opensea.io/collection/thedudes)\n* [the duds](https://opensea.io/collection/theduds)\n* [the abstract dudes](https://opensea.io/collection/the-abstract-dudes)\n* [the pixels](https://opensea.io/collection/the-pixels-inc)\n\nI don't know about you, but the innovation within this project and the pure creative genius thedude possesses is seriously phenomenal! I'm intrigued to learn more and see what thedude ends up creating in the future! I highly recommend you follow the dudes over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thedudesnft) and join their [Discord](https://discord.gg/wM7HSMDV4B) so that you can keep up to date with all the latest details and collections being released by thedude!\n\nAnd that brings us to the conclusion of yet another seriously wicked MSQ Discovery of the Day!

But why is this happening if the Nigerian government recently announced a crackdown on Crypto?***\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n| No. | Section |\n|----:|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | [Introduction](#introduction) |\n| 2 | [Nigeria's Crises](#nigerias-crises) |\n| 3 | [Crypto to the Rescue!](#crypto-to-the-rescue)|\n| 4 | [Foreign 'Intervention' (The Good Kind)](#foreign-intervention-the-good-kind) |\n\n## Nigeria's Crises\n\nNigeria is a country plagued by social unrest and rampant inflation.\n\nIn October 2020, the most populous African nation saw massive [public demonstrations](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-54678345/) against police brutality. After authorities tore into protesters with tear gas and water cannons, 69 people were killed and many more horribly injured.\n\nThe Nigerian government reacted by freezing the bank accounts of organizations that were helping protesters. They also froze the accounts of people speaking out against government policies.\n\nThe majority of goods purchased in Nigeria are imported. In 2019, Nigeria's [imported goods](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/nga/) accounted for $52.5 billion, making it the 50th largest trade destination in the world.\n\nThe Nigerian currency is the Naira, which is highly volatile. Throughout 2021, the inflation rate has hovered around 18%. To hedge against this, Nigerians prefer to pay for their imported goods with US Dollars. However, US Dollars are hard to come by.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EzZLZyt.jpg)\n\n> Money printer go brrrr!\n\n## Crypto to the Rescue!\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin trading platform [Paxful](https://paxful.com/), Nigeria is now second only to the US for Bitcoin trading. The Dollar volume of crypto received by users in Nigeria in May 2021 was $2.4 billion, up from $684 million in December 2020.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pIBNZYF.png)\n\nDespite talks of regulating and banning cryptocurrencies in Nigeria, the market keeps going from strength to strength. Distrustful of banks that can freeze your account, Nigerians are using cryptocurrencies to feed their families, run their businesses and educate their children.\n\nThe young and educated population along with increased internet adoption has helped to facilitate the exponential adoption of Bitcoin. The borderless nature of Bitcoin makes it a viable option for making both local and international payments. [Cryptofully.com](https://www.cryptofully.com/) is a great example in this case. Cryptofully allows people to send money to Nigeria using Peer-2-Peer (P2P) networking. The crypto is then converted into Naira. Using the Cryptofully app, users can send and receive crypto, pay bills and earn rewards.\n\nNigerians are also taking advantage of the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Industry and using DeFi loans to run their businesses. Being unbanked is no longer a barrier to raising capital and running a business in Nigeria.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/h98e5nX.jpg)\n\n[Xend Finance](https://xend.finance/) is a Nigerian DeFi start-up that enables credit unions to access DeFi for their members by using decentralized stablecoins such as DAI and BUSD. Members can take out loans and earn interest on their savings. In a country that has seen 3 massive currency devaluations over the last 3 years, projects such as Xend Finance offer hope and a way out of poverty for many Nigerians. \n\n> *'We target non-crypto users, financially underserved users and users in unstable economies that need their assets to be protected by any means necessary. We are the answers to their prayers'* - Ugochukwu Aronu, CEO and founder of Xend Finance\n\n## Foreign 'Intervention' (The Good Kind)\n\nOne cryptocurrency that has set its sights firmly on the African market is [Electroneum](https://electroneum.com/), a mobile-based digital payments platform powered by Blockchain. It enables people to send transactions anywhere in the world quickly and affordably. Users can also top-up their mobile phones and pay utility bills using the native coin, ETN. The Nigerian market is a perfect fit for Electroneum. Users are generally young mobile phone users who are keen to adopt new technologies.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BUh6oud.png)\n\nThe Nigerian government has announced plans to release its own digital currency later in 2021. However, it remains to be seen if this is embraced as enthusiastically as independent cryptocurrencies.",

        "slug": "what-is-an-nft-beginners-guide",
        "body": "***So you wanna learn about NFTs, huh? Well...you've come to the right place! In this article we'll explore what an NFT is and how to mint one. We'll also talk about how to avoid scams and cover a couple of general tips and tricks along the way. Finally, we'll dive into some cool projects for you to consider starting off with. Let's go!*** \n\n> **Please Note** - In no way, shape or form should this article be considered financial advice. Always do your due diligence and make an informed decision before committing capital towards any investment.\n\n## What's an NFT? What's a Blockchain?\n\nSo, what *is* an NFT? Well, that's a great question. The official definition is: \n\n> 'A non-fungible token is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable. NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files'\n\nNow if you're anything like me, I'm going to take a wild guess and assume that all of the above didn't exactly hit home, so let's break it down a little, shall we?\n\n*Non-fungible* means that the token is more or less unique and cannot be replaced with something else. For example, cryptocurrencies, like [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), they are **fungible** because you can exchange BTC or ETH for another currency, be it fiat or otherwise. You can also use BTC and ETH to purchase products or services from different merchants across the world. However, in contrast, something like Cryptopunk #7523 is **non-fungible** because there is only one in existence, making it unique, scarce and very rare. Morever, it cannot be readily exchanged or converted into another currency or used to make a purchase, hence it is non-fungible.\n\nNow that we have that out the way...What's a Blockchain? For some of you, this might be something you already know well. But hey, we're all about learning here at MSQ, so it never hurts to refresh your memory, right? Simply put, a Blockchain is the technology that underpins NFTs. While there are several explanations of a Blockchain, we rather like this one:\n\n> 'A Blockchain is an open and public network that is secure and extremely difficult to tamper with. Moreover, it allows for the existence and exchange of digital assets that aren't issued by central governments'\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/N70cdty.png)\n\n> Cryptopunk #7523\n\n## OK, I Get it Now, But What Uses Do NFTs Have?\n\nNow that we've explained what NFTs are and the technology behind them, let's dive into why some are selling for thousands or even millions of dollars. We'll also discuss some of the uses they have and where you might find them...\n\n### Collectibles\n\nA common theme we see in the current NFT space is PFP (Profile Picture) projects. This is where 10,000 (or a similar amount) of randomly generated NFTs will be created with the entire process being carried out via a smart contract. An example of a randomly generative PFP project is [Lazy Lions](https://www.lazylionsnft.com/) that's been all over Twitter lately.\n\nIn these projects, each NFT is entirely unique, meaning no two are exactly the same. Many projects have tons of traits that characters may possess with some being rarer than others. A lot of people like to collect these types of NFTs and flip them for a profit, but some of these projects simply feature such awesome and distinct artwork, which is why their popularity is so enduring.\n\nNFT projects like [SuperNfty Floating Heads](https://www.supernfty.com/) and [Dead Freaks](https://opensea.io/collection/dead-freaks) are two of my favorites to date. All Dead Freaks are hand drawn and feature unnervingly ghoulish (or even downright terrifying) monstrosities complete with their own dreadful, shall we say...personalities? Owning a Dead Freak gives you access to the Fang Gang, making you eligible for special drops and more!\n\nIn stark contrast, [SuperNfty Floating Heads](https://opensea.io/collection/super-nfty-floating-heads) are all hand sculpted in VR (super nifty, right?) and feature lively, colorful floating heads complete with a range of different potential applications. Upon purchasing one, you receive your head's commercial license as well as a 3D printable file, metaverse file and more! See? I told you they were super nifty!\n\n### Gaming\n\n> NFTs and Gaming: a match made in heaven. You can check out my esteemed colleague [Matt Spizarny](https://MSQ.io/users/spizzo) AKA Spizzo's article on Gaming & NFTs and why they go so well together [here](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/the-bittersweet-relationship-of-gaming-and-nfts)\n\nOne of the main points here is that you can truly own really cool stuff in a digital world. Nobody can take your in-game items away from you because *you* own them. Additionally, they exist on a decentralized network and are inaccessible to anyone but you. You can sell your items, trade them, level them up to make them rarer...it's just fantastic! Some Blockchain games I think are pretty rad (and ones you may want to check out soon) include [Blankos: Block Party](https://blankos.com/), [Lost Relics](https://lostrelics.io/) and [Ember Sword](https://embersword.com/).\n\n### Access Tokens\n\nFinally, NFTs can be used as access tokens. [GET Protocol](https://www.get-protocol.io/) is one such example of an entity that fulfills this flawlessly— they help anyone who issues tickets to take advantage of the digital world by turning tickets into...you guessed it: NFTs!\n\nNow transforming tickets into NFTs has many advantages. First off, it makes tickets into collectible items that have (and may very well increase in) value. Secondly, organizers get total control over the issuing process as well as insights into both the primary & secondary markets. Lastly, organizers and performers receive all the profits that would have otherwise gone to scalpers and intermediaries. In short, GET is making serious progress in fundamentally changing the way the ticketing industry operates.\n\nThe above are just a few of the current uses for NFTs, but in my opinion, the possibilities are virtually endless!\n\n## How Do I Mint an NFT?\n\nSo in this section, I'm going to take you step-by-step through the minting process so that you can purchase your first NFT. This is going to be a lot of fun, so without further ado, let's dive straight in:\n\nBefore we begin, you're going to need a few things to get started:\n\n* A [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet\n* Some ETH, and\n* An [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) account (which just means you'll need to log in to your MetaMask wallet)\n\nAs a newbie, you can buy ETH directly inside your MetaMask wallet by clicking on 'Buy.' The following image demonstrates how to buy some ETH:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jS8wTFF.png)\n\nOnce you have your wallet set up, OpenSea account and some ETH, it's time to mint your first NFT! How exciting!\n\nNow comes the hardest part: finding an NFT project you actually want to invest in. There are *thousands* of NFT projects out there, and it can be really difficult to determine which ones will do well and which won't. However, these are a few factors I like to take into account: \n\n* **Artwork** - Is it distinct, memorable and relatable?\n* **Community** - How active and united are the community?\n* **Developers** - Are they trustworthy, driven, forward-thinking and innovative?\n* **Roadmap** - Is there a roadmap for the project? What releases are planned and how will they help to grow the community and project as a whole?\n\nSo let's take [Approving Corgis](https://approvingcorgis.com/public-mint/) as an example.\n\nApproving Corgis is a collection of 9,999 adorable corgis living on the Ethereum Blockchain, generated using 350+ unique attributes. Awesome, now let's say you want to mint one. First, head over to their [website](https://approvingcorgis.com/public-mint/) and click the **Mint** button. We can see that 2,191 have been minted, so there's still plenty left to purchase.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/I40O3xd.png)\n\nAfter clicking the **Mint** button and connecting your wallet, the site will tell you the minting price and ask you how many you would like to mint. In this case, let's say I want to mint 1. After inputting the amount I'd like to mint, I click the **Mint** button.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/etq7gpS.png)\n\nAfter hitting the **Mint** button, your MetaMask will pop up at the top-right of your screen. Here you can review your transaction. The details include the minting price, which in this case is 0.05 ETH plus gas fees.\n\nHold on a minute...what are gas fees!? These are payments made by users to compensate for the computing energy required to process and validate transactions on the Ethereum Blockchain. Gas fees can vary drastically and sometimes be very high, making your transaction significantly more expensive. You can check what price gas is currently sitting at [here](https://etherscan.io/gastracker).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jfOtCVr.png)\n\nCongrats! You're ready to mint! Just hit the **Confirm** button and let the Blockchain do its job. In a few minutes, you should see your brand new NFT show up in your OpenSea wallet. Easy as that! Wasn't so hard, was it?\n\nDepending on the project you're minting from, there may not be an instant reveal. This means you will have to wait until your NFT is available to see which one you got and what traits it has. This isn't really a big deal, but it varies from project to project, so just be sure to check their website before minting so you know what's up!\n\n## Tips & Tricks\n\nLet's run through some final quick-fire tips and tricks, shall we?\n\n* Never give anyone your private keys or seed phrases under any circumstances whatsoever\n* If MetaMask isn't working on Google Chrome, try Firefox\n* Be sure to always double check that you are on the project's official website and/or OpenSea\n* Losing Gas Wars?

        "slug": "memorable-experiences-lasting-bonds-get-protocol",
        "body": "***We recently unveiled that GET Protocol is our [September 2021 Project of the Month](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/get-protocol-is-our-project-of-the-month-september-2021), and for good reason too. However, while we've touched on their achievements and products, we haven't really gotten into the nitty-gritty of what they're actually trying to achieve. There's more to this project than good tech and a dedicated team. Indeed, by focusing on the most important part of the equation, namely real human beings, GET is striving for something far more profound than meets the eye...***\n\n## The Golden Ticket\n\nWhen you want to attend a concert or similar big event, you log on to the internet, navigate to a major ticket company and make your purchase. The amount you spend and the type of ticket you acquire will have a significant influence on your overall experience, but beyond this, your ticket serves no further purpose...it's simply a means to an end.\n\nBut you aren't the only person who holds a ticket. In all likelihood, there are many other people all holding their own tickets with their own respective benefits and/or limitations. What do you know about these people though? Anything at all? How could you have anything in common with them? Well, for one, you're attending the same event as them, so there's little doubt that some kind of connection exists, no matter how fleeting or transient it might be.\n\nYou might not want to be bosom pals with every single event-goer, but maybe you wouldn't mind spending a good night out with one or more of them again. After all, a concert isn't much if it doesn't come complete with an enraptured crowd all uproariously shouting their praises for performers and musicians. There's something truly transcendent about such events, and it's these experiences that are etched into the memories of people all over the world.\n\nLive events are built on human relationships and camaraderie between attendees, organizers and performers. But these meaningful connections are severed once the lights go out and everyone goes home. But this need not be the case. Imagine there was a way to keep everyone in the ticketing chain connected before, during and after an event. Sounds unfeasible? Think again. [GET Protocol](https://www.get-protocol.io/) already has this covered. Thanks to their innovative approach to ticketing, the functionality, versatility, and overall value attached to their tickets ensures that everyone in the chain is a winner. In essence, there isn't just one 'Golden Ticket.' The reality is...they all are!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hHQfr5q.jpg)\n\n> GET Protocol's approach means every ticket is a Golden Ticket\n\n## Entertainment in a World of Uncertainty\n\nIt's no secret that the outbreak of the Coronavirus has had a major impact on businesses and individuals all over, and the entertainment industry has been one of the most adversely affected thus far. While it may be true that nothing is certain, it goes without saying that the levels of uncertainty post Corona are at an all-time high.\n\nEvent organizers run the risk of suffering huge losses and having to spend a massive amount of time making new arrangements if an event is postponed or canceled. Moreover, fans are disinclined to purchase tickets because they may believe the event simply won't happen or that they won't get their money back. In the meantime, musicians and performers miss out on opportunities to share their art, grow their fan bases and earn a living. What can be done to minimize risks and safeguard the interests of all parties concerned?\n\nThe answer is simple: you employ the best Blockchain-based ticketing service on the market with innovative products and a fully inclusive, connection-first approach. Yup, I'm talking about GET Protocol again. What exactly affords these guys such an edge over their centralized and entrenched counterparts? A good combination of gusto, real-world experience and a philosophy that favors interconnection, innovation and progression of course. Much of this is possible thanks to GET's [White-Label](https://www.get-protocol.io/white-label), a product designed to nurture human connections and ensure they grow and last.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UWGvKEj.png)\n\n> White-Label brings an entirely new element to the world of live events\n\nThe benefits of GET Protocol’s White-Label product are immediately apparent: any inspired entrepreneur, fledgling ticketing business or event organizer can replicate the battle-tested and complete white-label ticketing solution that has been employed at real events across the world. Going from zero ticketing to scalable ticketing with a fully customizable suite of tools that provide event organizers with more data, greater revenue and, most importantly, a clear connection between artists and attendees, is all possible thanks to White-Label. As GET puts it:\n\n> *'Our white-label has also revealed some gleaming benefits during the current pandemic, as an ever changing event climate has resulted in many events needing canceling or rescheduling for dates and location. With the white-label, GUTS Tickets could transfer 40k+ tickets for a singular event to a new venue at the flick of a button whilst keeping revenue'*\n\nNow I don't know about you, but that sounds like pure magic to me. Just the total number of hours saved is something worth celebrating, let alone the fact that attendees can still get what they paid for and organizers can retain their revenue. If this isn't a quantum leap forward in the world of event planning and organizing, I don't know what is.\n\n## No More Scalpers\n\nMaybe one of the biggest benefits allowing people from all walks of life to come together and enjoy themselves is GET's approach to eliminating scalping. This is because any tickets issued through GET are 'smart tickets' tied to a Blockchain. This means that only individuals with the requisite authority can make any changes to tickets in terms of benefits, restrictions and pricing (to name but a few). In other words, anyone wanting to buy large quantities of tickets, mark them up and sell them for a profit in the secondary market simply can't because they lack the agency and ability to do so. The result is that tickets remain fairly priced, accessible to all and incapable of being altered, sabotaged or reproduced.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/D0WTygC.jpg)\n\n> Only if you don't use GET Protocol Buzz...\n\nThe reality is that if any kind of resale or discount is permitted, it's only because the organizers of the event allow it. The real beauty of GET Protocol is that event organizers set the rules and can customize their attendees' experiences down to the finest detail. Additionally, all of this can be done almost instantly without having to take any laborious, time-intensive actions. Virtually every last aspect of the ticketing and live event experience has been considered, and so the whole process is effectively automated. As soon as companies in other parts of the world get wind of GET's unparalleled tech, I expect a mass exodus the likes of which can only be described as Biblical in scale.\n\n## Mementos? Memorabilia? NFTs!\n\nTo top all this excellence off, GET also offers [the Digital Twin](https://www.get-protocol.io/digital-twin), a product that gives ticket issuers the world over the ability to 'supercharge' their tickets by creating Non-Fungible Token (NFT) replicas of them, thereby transforming them into provably rare items with intrinsic value. Best of all, existing ticket providers need not make any major migrations to a new platform or modify their operations to integrate this technology. GET's *Digital Twin* allows them to create 'NFT copies' of their existing and future tickets and store them digitally on a Blockchain. This means that these pieces of memorabilia or rewards (depending on the preferences of ticket providers) cannot be destroyed, tampered with or stolen and will always be accessible to individuals who own these NFTs.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/akuAlNC.png)\n\n> Just a small sample of the benefits by using GET Protocol\n\nI said it once, and I'll say it again: every ticket issued or enhanced by GET Protocol is golden. In fact, it would be incorrect to call them a Blockchain-based smart ticketing solution. That just doesn't do them justice. They're much closer to something like magicians or wizards if you ask me. In all seriousness though, what GET Protocol does is far deeper than the tech, innovation and slick aesthetics: they empower people to achieve more, connect more and communicate more directly and honestly with one another. They also facilitate the creation of memorable experiences free from strife, ambivalence and confusion. What more could you possibly want?\n\nWhat's more, you'll want to hang on to your tickets and cherish them because they're actually worth something and have meaning. Not so long ago (and even still) tickets just allowed you to enter an event and access certain areas. Thankfully GET Protocol has seen the light and made it their mission to fully unleash the potential within each and every ticket they produce or augment. Few Blockchain projects are this committed to their audience and ethos, and it is this commitment to excellence and progress that has earned GET Protocol the title of our September 2021 Project of the Month.\n\n## Memories That Live On\n\nI can tell you that, as part of the MSQ team, we value the humans behind projects, NFTs and games and want to tell their stories in an authentic and meaningful way. It's little wonder then that we 'GET' along so well with GET Protocol and identify with their vision for a better world.\n\nBy focusing on the real experiences of people in their daily lives, and by allowing them to have some agency in these experiences (and feel valued for their individual contributions), there is little doubt that a community of empowered, united people is coming to life. By giving people the opportunity to get more back from and feel included in events, GET has managed to tap into the hearts and minds of their audience and demonstrate that they really do put human beings and their needs first.",

        "name": "Scaling: Peeling Back the Layers",
        "slug": "scaling-peeling-back-the-layers",
        "body": "***'The Scalability Trilemma' taught us to think differently in how we approach the issue of scaling Blockchain networks and revealed that our perceived limitations are often based on incorrect assumptions. In this article, we continue our journey by peeling back the layers to reveal what scaling looks like today as well as what the future holds.***\n\n---\n\nOn our last adventure down the crypto rabbit hole, we looked at the [Scalability Trilemma](https://MSQ.io/blog/the-scalability-trilemma) and discussed the concept of scaling and how it applies to Blockchain architecture using the concept of 'Layers.' We also learned that our limitations are often rooted in false assumptions about what we *can* do.\n\nIn this article, we'll continue our journey by 'peeling back the layers' to get a better look at just how these layers are used and what solutions currently exist. There is indeed some ground to cover, but fear not, young Padawan...for the Force will be with you, always!\n\nWe got this! ✊\n\n![](https://media1.giphy.com/media/GvGEWpWm7vJra/giphy.gif)\n\n## Ready Layer-1\n\n![(Warner Bros./Getty Images/Ringer illustration)](https://i.ibb.co/X5QZCjk/1-0-Zr-Llr8w-DTtcz-Jea-Mgn9v-A-0-0-0.gif)\n\nMuch like the [Oasis](https://readyplayerone.fandom.com/wiki/OASIS) in [Ready Player One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One_(film)), a Blockchain's Layer-1 (L1) is considered the 'Base Layer.' This is the lowest level where solutions affect the main way that a Blockchain works. To scale on L1 means changing the rules of the protocol itself and doesn't offer much to combat the [inherent issues](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/the-scalability-trilemma#the-trilemma) involved in L1 scaling.\n\nFor instance, the *Oasis* doesn't seem to have any major latency issues, and that's because it suffers from a high level of centralization. I mean, the entire premise of the story *is* a race for control over its fate. And while a more robust architecture spanning multiple layers sounds awesome, it would make for a pretty boring story...'IOI' could be like, 'All your eggs are belong to us! Bwahahaha!' and everyone else would just be like, 'Cool story, bro.'\n\n<div style=\"width: 75%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/RpzTrf6/Halliday.jpg)\n  \n> \"If you push [the button]...and the whole simulation shuts down.\"\n\n</div>\n\n---\n\n**Bonus Content**: [MSQ Youtube: The Blockchains of 'Ready Player One'](https://youtu.be/_PYKp06wlGY) by [Justin Renken](https://MSQ.io/users/justin)\n\n---\n\n### Consensus Changes\n\n***'Consensus changes'*** affect how blocks are created.\n\n![src: https://ig.com](https://i.ibb.co/99Fg38T/consensus.png)\n\nMost notably, on the [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org) Network, different ideas on how consensus should operate have led to contentious forks that resulted in projects like [Bitcoin Cash](https://bitcoincash.org) and [Bitcoin Gold](https://bitcoingold.org).\n\nIn [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) 2.0, the consensus algorithm will change from [Proof-of-Work (PoW)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) to [Proof-of-Stake (PoS)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake). The main idea behind this is to allow for faster block creation by getting rid of the computational overhead associated with mining/PoW.\n\nIn PoS, blocks are processed and validated by network participants who instead are required to stake collateral on-chain. This effectively incentivizes being honest since they have 'skin in the game.' Basically, acting dishonestly means losing some of their collateral via a mechanism known as [slashing](https://consensys.net/knowledge-base/ethereum-2/glossary/#slashing).\n\n### Sharding\n\n***[Sharding](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture))*** changes how the network itself is distributed.\n\n![https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html - Original diagram by Hsiao-wei Wang, design by Quantstamp](https://i.ibb.co/ZfwKGRS/sharding.jpg)\n\nWith sharding, a network's database is split across different sub-networks where each 'shard' contains a portion of the network's data. In the case of Ethereum 2.0, the main chain becomes one of these shards and will be the only one allowed to process transactions or execute smart contracts, where an additional [Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain) coordinates communication between the main chain and its shards.\n\n## Layer-2: Insert Coin\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/gMCfv0F/F6-A16-FF7-33-C5-4483-A138-4210-F8-B29-EB4.gif)\n\n</div>\n\nIn contrast to L1 solutions, Layer-2 (L2) solutions change the way you *use* a Blockchain and can function independently from the main chain.\n\nIn our [Scalability Trilemma](https://MSQ.io/blog/the-scalability-trilemma) article, we compared L1 vs L2 to writing a penalty in grade school with L1 being the act of writing 50 lines by hand onto a single sheet of paper. L2 would be more like typing the line once, then copy-pasting the remaining lines before printing it off to turn in to your teacher.\n\n### State Channels\n\n***'State Channels'*** use multi-signature contracts that allow participants to interact freely off-chain with the final results settling on the main chain. State Channels can be implemented in various ways that are often application-specific.\n\n![https://research.csiro.au/blockchainpatterns/general-patterns/data-management-patterns/state-channel](https://i.ibb.co/NTxM29G/state-channels.png)\n\nOne notable example of a State Channel is the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network) which creates peer-to-peer (P2P) payment channels where the final results settle on the [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org) Network.\n\nThe drawback to using State Channels is that the main chain has no way to validate what takes place off-chain. Each solution requires that participants rely on the security of the protocol they're using.\n\nThis can be thought of as something like having a table at a swap or rummage sale. Payments and items can change hands quite a bit over the duration of the sale. But at the end of the day, everyone gets paid out accordingly.\n\nProjects using State Channels:\n\n* [Connext](https://connext.network)\n* [Kchannels](https://www.kchannels.io)\n* [Perun](https://perun.network)\n* [Raiden](https://raiden.network)\n* [Statechannels.org](https://statechannels.org)\n\n### Sidechains\n\n***'Sidechains'*** are essentially clones of their main chain. They're, functionally speaking, almost completely identical; the only distinctions being that they run in *parallel* to the main chain and often implement their own consensus algorithms.\n\n![https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Sidechain](https://i.ibb.co/Q9MmyTP/sidechain.png)\n\nOn Ethereum, Sidechains are based on the [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm) and are even able to execute Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nSidechains, like State Channels, also require that participants rely on the security of the protocol they're using as the main chain has no way to guarantee data that's processed off-chain.\n\nProjects using Side Chains:\n\n* [POA Network](https://www.poa.network)\n* [Skale](https://skale.network)\n* [xDai](https://www.xdaichain.com)\n\n### Plasma\n\n***'Plasma'*** chains are anchored to their main 'parent' as a 'child' chain. While each 'child' has its own consensus model, its primary function is to offload computations from their 'parent' chain.\n\n![https://coincentral.com/plasma-an-innovative-framework-to-scale-ethereum](https://i.ibb.co/yqJFV9D/plasma.jpg)\n\nMuch like [Optimistic Rollups](#rollups), discussed further below, Plasma chains submit a transaction *'fraud proof'* to their parent.\n\nA popular analogy to explain Sidechains is to compare child chains to a Casino. You swap Dollars for poker chips, then cash out when you're done, basically ensuring that your chips are backed by something of the same value.\n\nProjects using Plasma:\n\n* [Gazelle](https://gzle.io)\n* [Gluon](https://gluon.network)\n* [LeapDAO](https://ipfs.leapdao.org)\n* [OMG Network](https://omg.network)\n* [Polygon](https://polygon.technology)\n\n### Rollups\n\n***'Rollups'*** are one of the newest and most promising ways to further scale a Blockchain.\n\nOne way to think about Rollups is to consider the act of sending holiday cards to your Aunt and Uncle. Using L1 methods, you could send one card to each of them as well as each of your cousins. Using L2 would be more like putting all the cards into one envelope and sending them together. So one stamp vs five stamps, which is cheaper and less work for the Post Office, and your relatives still get all the cards.\n\nThe key advantage of Rollups over other L2 scaling solutions is that Rollups require that proofs be committed to the main chain. This means users don't have to rely solely on the security of a given L2 implementation as transactions and contract executions can be secured by the main chain.\n\n**Optimistic Rollups**\n\n***'Optimistic Rollups'*** batch transactions and contract executions off-chain and commit the result to the parent chain along with a 'fraud proof'.\n\n![https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups](https://i.ibb.co/wpG51td/rollups-optimistic.png)\n\nA 'fraud proof' is an on-chain 'statement' or 'promise' that can be challenged by any party that suspects fraud. These statements and challenges require collateral to be locked by each party, where either acting dishonestly means losing some (or all) of their locked collateral. Results committed to a parent chain by Optimistic Rollups are essentially presumed to be correct... (<-- that's the 'optimistic' part).\n\nThis is kinda like playing [Guess Who](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_Who) or [Battleship](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)). Players operate on the honor system, except bystanders are allowed to call out cheaters. If the player *was* cheating, their funds get slashed; but if the challenger was wrong, *their* funds get slashed.\n\nIn the case of Optimistic Rollups, the challenge period can last up to a week or more. This gives extra time for the transactions to be scrutinized but also means users have to wait to withdraw their funds until after the challenge period has ended.\n\nProjects using Optimistic Rollups:\n\n* [Cartesi](https://cartesi.io)\n* [Fuel Network](https://fuel.sh)\n* [Offchain Labs Arbitrum Rollup](https://offchainlabs.com)\n* [OMGX](https://omgx.network)\n* [Optimism](https://optimism.io)\n\n**ZK Rollups**\n\n***'ZK Rollups'*** batch transactions and contract executions off-chain, but commit the result to the parent chain along with a cryptographically provable 'validity proof' known as a 'zk-SNARK', or *Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge.*\n\n![https://medium.com/fcats-blockchain-incubator/how-zk-rollups-work-8ac4d7155b0e](https://i.ibb.co/ynsrW0y/rollups-zk.png)\n\nWait...ZK what?\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/dg3jdHD/hold-up.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nZero-knowledge...Succinct...Mmkay...So that's some pretty heavy terminology, to say the least. What this *basically* means is that, instead of assuming 'optimistically' that all participants are being honest, the on-chain commit includes mathematical evidence *proving* the results are valid without revealing details about what happened inside the batch.\n\nThis, in a way, would be more like playing [Scrabble](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble). Players can't see each other's tiles until they're placed on the board, and the only way to make a new word is to branch off one that already exists. You can't just add gibberish with tiles you don't have on an empty section of the board...and if you do, I'm *totally* not playing with you anymore.\n\nProjects using ZK-Rollups:\n\n* [Aztec 2.0](https://aztec.network)\n* [Hermez Network](https://hermez.io)\n* [Loopring](https://loopring.org)\n* [Matter Labs zkSync](https://zksync.io)\n* [Starkware](https://starkware.co)\n* [zkTube](https://zktube.io)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nL1 and L2 solutions *do* offer great ways to approach scaling. However, the true benefits are realized when they are used in conjunction.\n\nA perfect example of this duality are the many changes involved on the road to [ETH 2.0](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2) which include consensus changes, the addition of the [Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain), and sharding ability. These upgrades prime Ethereum's L1 to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the various L2 solutions we covered earlier in this article.\n\n*How* exactly the ETH 2.0 upgrades work to better-serve L2 scaling solutions totally warrants a separate article altogether, but hopefully our adventure thus far has served to bring the massive potential a bit more into focus.\n\n---\n\nThe journey doesn’t end here!

        "body": "***It's that time again good people of the cryptosphere. That's right, we know you love DeFi, and so do we. While Ethereum may be the hegemon in the DeFi space, there are other platforms and protocols being developed on other promising ecosystems that hope to resolve some of the longstanding issues within Decentralized Finance. Allow me to introduce Apricot Finance, a next-gen lending protocol built on Solana...***\n\n## A New Kid on the Block\n\nI may have been born in the late '80s and missed the debut of [New Kids on the Block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kids_on_the_Block) in 1984, but it doesn't mean I can't appreciate their contributions to Pop Culture in general. I mean, who could forget hits like *Tonight,* *You Got It (The Right Stuff)* and of course, the inimitable *Step by Step*? Not me, that's for sure!\n\nOK, I'll level with you...I can't say I really know NKOTB (sorry Donnie!) all that well. Me? I'm more of a [Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marky_Mark_and_the_Funky_Bunch) kinda guy. Man was 1991 a great year to be alive! The USSR pretty much broke up, Operation Desert Storm kicked into high gear, and of course, [Mark Wahlberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Wahlberg)'s stone cold Hip-Hop project saw the light of day. What I wouldn't give for an original copy of *Music for the People*, I tell you...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jcGmFIz.jpg)\n\n> Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a picture of this guy with a shirt on?\n\nOh right, you aren't here for trivia about musical projects of yesteryear that happen to feature one of the Wahlbergs. Forgive me, I just can't help but feel nostalgic, ya know? Although I'm not sure nostalgia is really all it's cracked up to be. See, not everything you used to think was 'cool' and 'hip' is anymore...and maybe it was never all that great in the first place (I'm not hating on the Wahlbergs by the way). 56k dial-up modems, telex, DVDs (feel old yet?) and fax machines (which have never been cool) all served a purpose once, and for a time they were the cutting edge of modern technology. Funny, isn't it, that in a few short years, these once coveted technological marvels have become largely or completely obsolete? Ah, the transience of time...\n\nSee, this principle doesn't just apply to music or culture or IT, no, no. In fact, it's pretty far-reaching and all-encompassing. Given the accelerated pace at which tech is developing, technologies can be supplanted virtually overnight if uptake and buy-in is great enough. Now, that DeFi protocol you've been using...how's it working out for you? Maybe you've had an awesome experience and made a ton of cash— more power to you! Or maybe, just maybe, it's been a bit more 'complicated' for you and things haven't gone as well as you would have hoped.\n\nPerhaps it's just bad luck, or maybe some earlier DeFi protocols just have a few unfortunate aspects that make them inefficient or less attractive: liquidity issues, impermanent loss, smart contract vulnerabilities...the list goes on and on. Accessibility and adoption depend largely on user-friendliness and protection, so if protocols consistently fail to address the very real concerns of their audiences, their longevity is far from assured...\n\nThe old is inevitably replaced by the new, and the more efficient, convenient and effective supplants the obsolete, redundant and impractical. That's just the way the system works, and in DeFi, there are a few new kids on the block...and [Apricot Finance](https://apricot.one/) is one of them.\n\n## Talkin' 'Bout My (New) Generation\n\n'Next-gen' was once just a buzzword that game developers and the like slapped onto their releases to build hype and sell their not-so-next-gen wares to the unsuspecting public. However, with the advent of truly revolutionary tech and software such as [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5), 'next-gen' is finally here.\n\nNow while it may not be a blockbuster game with high-end graphics, Apricot Finance is, for all intents and purposes, a next-gen DeFi platform. How can they claim such a thing, you may ask? Well, firstly, their protocol is built on top of [Solana](https://solana.com/), the very same Blockchain platform the much anticipated [Star Atlas](https://staratlas.com/) calls home. It's no secret that Solana is a major player in the cryptosphere and arguably one of the fastest growing ecosystems at present. It promises to be 'low cost forever' as well as 'fast forever,' not to mention highly scalable and fully decentralized. That definitely sounds like a winning combination to me.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ovz1W5p.png)\n\nOf course, being built on Solana doesn't make Apricot Finance truly revolutionary or next-gen on its own. Naturally, a good portion of the real magic comes from the mechanics of the protocol itself. Simply put, Apricot is divided into three interconnected parts or products, namely **Lend**, **X-Farm** and **Assist**. However, before we dive deeper, Apricot just released their [testnet](https://test.apricot.one/), and if you ask me, the interface looks super slick and ultra streamlined.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UVCIwXe.png)\n\n> I'm sure I recognize those mesmerizing colors from somewhere...\n\nSo without further ado, let's check out each of Apricot's products in turn. First up, there's **Apricot Lend**, which, as you might have guessed, involves lending and borrowing. *Lend* serves as Apricot's base layer protocol that allows you to deposit select cryptoassets to earn interest. In addition, you can borrow from Apricot's platform and use your deposited assets as collateral. Now none of this is particularly remarkable, but the real difference with Apricot is that they are *cross-margin*, meaning you can deposit *any* assets, including LP tokens, in order to gain borrowing power. Freedom of choice anybody?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FrBa2M4.png)\n\nNow where things really start to get interesting is in Apricot's second product, namely **Apricot Cross-Farm (X-Farm)**. As Apricot themselves put it, 'cross-margin farming is a logical extension for a lending protocol,' and in all truth, it really is a mystery why nobody else has made any real attempts to go this route in the past. Perhaps the best part of *X-Farm* is that it allows users to start leveraged yield farming without ever having to actually own any of the underlying tokens. Normal yield farming takes place by using a stablecoin pair (such as USDC-USDT). What this means is that users have to convert their cryptoassets into those particular stablecoins and subsequently pool them.\n\nThe difference with *X-Farm* is that users can deposit non-stablecoin cryptoassets as collateral and borrow *both* with up to 3x leverage. In other words, no conversion is necessary, optimizing the process and allowing users a higher degree of control over their cryptoassets (not to mention peace of mind). After both stablecoins have been borrowed, they will be auto-pooled and consequently staked for Liquidity Provider (LP) Tokens, leading to 3x farming yields. The great news with *Apricot X-Farm* is that it encourages borrowing within the platform which results in a higher deposit rate, thus leading to more deposits.\n\n> **Please note:** At present *X-farm* only supports stablecoin LP pairs in order to negate the risk of impermanent loss\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/H1oG55G.png)\n\nOf course, DeFi, and in particular yield farming, isn't exactly a risk-free business. Heck, even some of the most experienced and savvy DeFi users find it time-consuming and strenuous to effectively manage their positions. Although *X-Farm* is awesome at increasing users' access to additional yield without requiring them to sell any assets, there's still the big L-word that every DeFi user fears when it comes to leverage: **Liquidation**. And this is where Apricot's third and final offering comes in...\n\nDon't like being liquidated, do ya? Nobody does, unless you're some kind of maniacal money masochist. Anyway, one of the worst feelings is being watched, especially by the nefarious scourge of liquidators, all salivating and wringing their greedy hands at the thought of depriving you of your hard-earned collateral the *instant* your position dips underwater. It's great to make money, but users need sleep, and they need to have some kind of safety net in place. Arguably the most innovative part of Apricot's overall value proposition is **Apricot Assist**, 'an automated self-deleveraging assistant' (fancy, no?) that you can carefully configure to aid you in reducing your account's leverage with your specific risk profile in mind.\n\nSo in principle, *Apricot Assist* gives you control over three different aspects:\n\n- **When** to sell or begin redeeming your collateral assets,\n- **What** assets should be sold or redeemed, and\n- **How much** of your chosen assets should be sold or redeemed\n\nSo imagine the following scenario: You decide to open a 3x leverage USDT-USDC LP position against your SOL and leave it overnight. Unfortunately, due to some unforeseen circumstance, the price of SOL falls substantially while you sleep. But you anticipated this possibility, (which is exactly why you slept soundly) and used *Apricot Assist* to take care of any less-than-desirable eventualities by configuring the following:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oKx5F64.png)\n\nIn essence, *Apricot Assist* ensures the 'borrow limit used' decreases to 90% and thus well within the realms of safety. As a result, all of your initial SOL principal is kept intact, and the overall size of your USDC-USDT LP position is similarly decreased since a lower leverage ratio means reduced rewards.\n\n*Apricot Assist* is fully programmable and will trigger in the event of any unfortunate circumstances, automatically managing your risk and maintaining your positions in your absence. In periods of high market volatility (which in crypto is something of a regular occurrence), *Apricot Assist* means that you can avoid liquidation all together.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JYVM7H0.png)\n\n## Kick Out the Jams!\n\nGreater freedom and peace of mind through innovative tools that do a lot of the heavy lifting for you, and the ability to more easily avoid liquidation are enough to qualify Apricot Finance as a next-gen DeFi platform. However, this isn't the end of the story...not yet at least. Here's a couple of major benefits I just have to highlight for you:\n\n- If a given user deposits **LP tokens** (which cannot be borrowed on Apricot's platform), Apricot will *auto-farm* for them. LP tokens grant users borrowing power which effectively allows them to farm stablecoin pairs\n- Users can also deposit **stablecoins** and get up to 3x leverage in order to farm stablecoin LP pairs, meaning that rewards can be earned simultaneously from both Apricot and Automated Market Makers (AMMs)\n- Finally, users can deposit **non-stable tokens** such as SOL or BTC (which isn't actually an option in other leveraged yield farming protocols as collateral) to leverage yield farm. As long as users ensure that they use *Apricot Assist* according to Apricot's specifications, there is little to no chance that their principal balance of SOL, BTC or other non-stable token will be negatively affected\n\nTo me, this all sounds like one thing...a winning combination! No matter what kind of cryptoassets you deposit, you receive some kind of borrowing power or benefit. While other protocols are bound by stringent limitations and overly technical interfaces, Apricot Finance has created an intuitive, open and, best of all, *intelligent* lending protocol. Now that's something to get excited about!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dHJa5CM.gif)\n\n> I'm all for extended metaphors, especially if synchronized dancing's involved...\n\n## You Got It (The Right Stuff)\n\n(See what I did there?) Apricot Finance may be new to the DeFi space, but having received $800,000 in initial seed funding and a further $4 million in their latest financing round, it's pretty clear they mean business. And when I say business, I mean taking the DeFi industry to the Dry Cleaners and getting every stain, wrinkle and fold out of every single suit in record time. Now if that ain't service, I don't know what is...\n\nSolana definitely boasts some truly impressive projects, and Apricot Finance is no exception. These guys have their own style, their own moves, and, who knows? They could very well be the next big thing in the world of DeFi. In any case, their offering isn't some cheap copy-paste of another protocol or a ham-fisted cash grab. Nope, this is DeFi done right with a profoundly more focused approach to the very specific needs of end users, and that's something we here at MSQ are very much behind.\n\nIt's little wonder why Apricot made the cut for this edition of ***DeFi Spotlight***. I gotta say, the more I find out about these protocols, the more excited I get about the future of DeFi. And am I sure glad to be part of this unstoppable shift towards a decentralized global economy! With this much momentum propelling them forward, I can say without hesitation that Apricot Finance is poised to make an invaluable addition to the DeFi industry, and I have no doubt their contributions will be substantial indeed.\n\n> This won't be the last you'll be hearing about **Apricot Finance**. I'll be sure to keep up with their progress and continue to bring you all the latest insights in the ever-evolving world of Decentralized Finance. Till next time!",

Inspired by [Dungeons & Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/) (D&D), using randomly generated environments, character skill sets, and at the center of it all...Loot. Non-Fungible Token (NFT) based games built on Blockchain have created new possibilities for the future of gaming. One game recently caught my attention, and it combines one of my favorite styles of games, Dungeon Crawlers, with the digital ownership aspects of Blockchain! You know I needed to check this out for myself. So, use a town portal, and 'Stay awhile and listen.' This...is [Lost Relics](https://lostrelics.io/).***\n\n## Greetings Warrior!\n\nDungeon Crawlers were first introduced to me when I was 9 years old with the release of [Diablo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_(video_game)) by [Blizzard Entertainment](https://www.blizzard.com/) in January 1997. Even at that young age, I was already a hardcore fanboy of *Blizzard* games, after hundreds of hours spent playing [Warcraft: Orcs & Humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft:_Orcs_%26_Humans) and its sequel [Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_II:_Tides_of_Darkness).\n\nI remember anxiously waiting for my mom to finish her morning routine so she could take me to buy a new game with the unlimited money I got from the recent Christmas holiday. Well...I had like, $75 dollars. So, like I said: unlimited funds! After what seemed like an eternity, mom was ready, and we left to purchase what would soon become my favorite game franchise (and genre) of all time: *Diablo*.\n\nI honestly had no idea what it even was and hadn't gone for it specifically, but the dark cover art, and just the fact it was made by *Blizzard*...I **had** to have it!\n\n![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MhW9taUdL._SL1092_.jpg)\n\n> Just look at it: the simple, clean, menacing imagery **still** looks amazing!\n\nLooking back, she probably shouldn't have bought it for me considering [The Entertainment Software Rating Board](https://www.esrb.org/) (ESRB) gave it an M for mature, but that was a relatively new thing at the time. Yeah, I know, I'm old. Nevertheless, she did, and I had managed to lay my hands on a game that would soon become a lifelong passion, and one I still play to this day.\n\n## The Loot Greed is *Real!*\n\nSome of you might be wondering what a Dungeon Crawler even is, just as I did when *Diablo* came into my life. Dungeon Crawlers, originally called 'Hack and Slash,' are RPGs that traditionally feature a medieval setting with a top-down view similar to Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games. They center around the rewards (or loot) you gain by killing monsters, creatures, demons, and whatever else you can possibly think of.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FcmA9YI.jpg)\n\n> The *Balrogs* from [Diablo 2](https://diablo2.blizzard.com/) are firebreathing demons that can quickly end your quest before you even notice, especially if you get surrounded\n\nWhat really makes *Diablo* special is its replay value. At the time, single player games were generally built around telling an intriguing and immersive story, and playing them again and again wasn't actually part of the mechanic. Having said this, some games did offer small incentive bonuses for second or third playthroughs, but **nothing** like this.\n\nThe experience of the game is the replay— it's the thrill of the hunt for loot combined with endlessly needing to stop *Diablo, the Lord of Terror,* from unleashing the demons of Hell into our world. I don't know about you, but this was more than enough for me. Each game you start off with always feel new and exciting since dungeon sequences or maps are randomly generated using a coding algorithm called 'Procedurally Generated Environments.' So no matter how many times you visit the 'Catacombs Level 2' fast travel waypoint, it always feels new, because it is!\n\n*Diablo* weaved a careful balance of story and replay value. While not as detailed as some other games of the time, the basic narrative is more than enough when paired with the built-in mechanic of needing new randomly determined loot drops. Oh, did I mention the added bonus of increased difficulties only playable with better loot? Well, that's also a feature, and this allows you to find even better...you guessed it— loot! Pure replay genius!\n\n![](https://www.gamersdecide.com/sites/default/files/content-images/news/2017/07/07/legendary-farming-10-tricks-and-tips/legendary-beams-galore.jpg)\n\n> That's...a lot of legendary loot. *Diablo 3* made missing good loot nearly impossible. In the first game, you would have no idea whether a legendary or unique item had dropped\n\nIt was also the first instance of a game I personally played using a system that would eventually be known as the 'The Grind,' a word used to describe how much time a progression system of an RPG's mechanics will take. Today this system is utilized in a variety of ways by most types of games. Even First Person Shooter (FPS) games have adopted progression systems, but for me, it was *Diablo* that first introduced 'The Grind.'\n\n## A Blockchain Dungeon Crawler!?\n\nWith the recent introduction of [MSQ Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjqDD3L3HjOTFRdc9H_-Pig) (which you should definitely check out and subscribe to), I find myself with probably the greatest job in the world for a passionate gamer involved with Blockchain— I get to research, play, and report on Blockchain games while getting to participate in a weekly scheduled stream every Wednesday and Friday from 9-11 AM EST.\n\nThis has led me to embrace a new world of digital ownership-based games that I might never have found on my own. While looking for potential games to stream, I stumbled upon one I simply couldn't resist trying out. This is a Dungeon Crawling, NFT-based, Play-to-Earn game developed by [Codebit Labs](https://codebitlabs.com/) on the [Enjin](https://enjin.io/) network which operates as a layer-2 solution on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain called, *Lost Relics*.\n\n![](https://nftplazas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lostrelicsblockchaingame.jpg)\n\n> The hours spent in this game and community weren't just for fun! It was research, OK? I **love** this game! It isn't work at all... \n\nAfter seeing a handful of images and reading about the concept, I couldn't wait to try *Lost Relics* out. Normally, I wait to do a breakdown of games that have potential after streaming them, saving the new experience in an attempt to showcase the confusion that can arise when trying to play Blockchain games. This time, however, I just couldn't wait. I can play and get randomly generated items from enemies that can be minted almost entirely in-game? **SOLD!**\n\nI did what I had to do. I installed the game and spent **hours** playing and learning. I quickly came to the conclusion that, in my opinion, *Lost Relics* is one of best transitions from a mainstream game format to a Blockchain game. An NFT-based version of a Dungeon Crawler that is **almost** perfect, and it's still in Alpha...its *Alpha!*\n\n## Accessing the World of Lost Relics \n\nEager to start my dungeon crawling, I headed to the *Lost Relics* website and clicked the 'Download' link. An account is required to initiate the download process, so I quickly set one up. However, I was informed that, in order to download a copy of the Alpha release, I'd have to purchase a 'Power Pendant,' or wait until the Beta released, which I was...definitely not going to do.\n\nThe website explains that 'Power Pendants' act as a limited-time subscription of sorts, unlocking special perks for your account until they run out. The times range from 1 to 90 days, with prices increasing with every level. Without hesitation, I opted for the 30 day pass. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SWSDuDe.png)\n\n> Yeah, I should have bought the 90 day— I. **LOVE**. This game.\n\nThere was a time when new users weren't required to purchase anything to access the game, but this is no longer the case. Nevertheless, I was late to this RPG party, so I had to pay. But before I could make any kind of purchase, I had to link my *Enjin* wallet to my newly created *Lost Relics* account, which was thankfully a simple process.\n\nOnce linked, my account was activated, thereby confirming my purchase and allowing me access to *Lost Relics*. Note that I already had an *Enjin* wallet set up from my previous [adventure](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/preview-the-six-dragons-beta), exploring [The Six Dragons](https://thesixdragons.com/). \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EhDY6Iq.png)\n\n> Check out the Preview on [MSQ](http://www.MSQ.io/)\n\n*The Lost Relics* was easy to install— most of the games I have tested so far (still in their Beta) have been complicated or confusing to install, but thankfully, this time was different.\n\nSo with a double click of the newly installed shortcut, into the world I went. Developer videos soon filled the screen followed by an explosion of the *Lost Relics* logo. Awesome! It transitioned to the login section that automatically logged me in, presenting the character screen. Wow!\n\nSeriously though, as dumb as it sounds, that's actually a big deal with some of the games I have tested lately: no extra hoops, no confirming email notification three times, nothing to do...just play the game— and that's exactly what I did.\n\n## Talmuth Awaits!\n\nI entered my new domain of Talmuth. The familiar overhead view employed by countless Dungeon Crawlers before it greeted me. It didn't have the standard bubble or orb style health and mana indicators, but these were easily identified with the standard item bar and skill slots visible.\n\nTo the north-east of me lay a cave entrance, but before I ventured forth into the unknown, I first decided to see what the key mapping was in relation to previous games. To my satisfaction, almost all of them were familiar to me. A notable exception is the [Q] key which allows you to swap from ranged to melee weapons.\n\nI then hit [M] to bring up my map, revealing words paired with matching icons that simply explained themselves— a blacksmith with an anvil, a stove with meat, alchemy with a vial, and so on.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gLNYiPD.jpg)\n\n> A common sight for weary adventurers. Even without the simple descriptions, they're pretty obvious. Good job!\n\nIgnorant of the dangers that lay ahead and filled with enthusiasm to start, I headed towards the cave. This brought up a screen to select what Dungeon Level I wanted to experience. Each level increases in difficulty, showcasing different varieties of enemies as well as different resources to be gathered.\n\n![](youtube:6gzhyu0Bl7g)\n\n> The list of dungeons available. This was very recently updated from the six I originally had to choose from\n\nAfter choosing the first one, a warning screen informed me that if I died while in a dungeon, I would lose all my items not saved to the Blockchain, as well as any experience (EXP) or gold I had acquired. Pfft! I won't die, I'm a veteran of these games! And so I entered the Level One dungeon...\n\n## Out of the Frying Pan and Into the Fire\n\nI warped into what looked like a castle cellar, similar to early levels in *Diablo 1*. Confidently, I pressed through the opening door. A pair of noises told me I had alerted two enemies that were now on their way to attack. A big-headed skeleton and a hulking mummy-like enemy soon appeared. I held the shift key to get into the appropriate stance and fired a volley of arrows at them. Each only required three to four arrows before dying and rewarded me with a meager 3-5 EXP.\n\nAs I progressed through the dungeon, encountering skeletons, boars, ghosts, and weird little guys that reminded me of *Pinkies* from [DOOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(franchise)), they slowly started to chip away at my 3,000 fixed Hit Points (HP). I sluggishly tried to swap weapons while maintaining my primary as ranged attacks, but before I knew it, I was dead. Hmm...Maybe I should learn more.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OkO6bIG.jpg)\n\n> Take too much damage, and you're done. 3,000 Health is all you get, regardless of level\n\nI respawned in town, defeated, and low. I didn't actually lose any items upon dying because I...hadn't collected any. To lift my spirits, I decided to head to town and do some exploring. I found a marketplace called the 'Royale Emporium' where items ranging from 'Common' to 'Transcendent' can be purchased and sold between players.\n\nSomething that sets *Lost Relics* apart is that the game provides you with the option to change the item marketplace from 'Virtual' to 'Blockchain.' 'Virtual' items can be purchased with in-game gold, and while these items are generally cheaper, they can be lost if you end up dying. Items from the 'Blockchain' section are minted NFTs created by paying a small fee to move any 'Uncommmon' or above item to the 'Blockchain' market (this is all explained through an easy to access link on the website).\n\n'Blockchain' items can only be bought using 'Shadowstones,' a resource acquired through converting *Enjin* tokens or by selling your 'Blockchain' items. 'Blockchain' items are NFTs paired to your account, meaning that if you die while using them, unlike 'Virtual' items, they won't be deleted. Simply put, you keep them stored in your Enjin wallet forever until you want to sell or trade them.\n\n![](youtube:jzCG053cSRI)\n\n> The 'Virtual' and 'Blockchain' marketplace. Both accept two different currencies, Gold and Shadowstones...I must have both!\n\n## A Quest Awaits!\n\nI next visited the 'Tavern', quickly realizing it was the spot to be. It was full of players standing idle or running around. As I walked in, an NPC spoke telling me about the weekly raffle for a high quality item. I walked to the left and attempted to buy a ticket for the raffle but obviously lacked the funds to do so. I moved on and explored the area, finding a few places to equip hats, and eventually discovered a stairwell that led me to my private room and stash.\n\n![](youtube:3y-Moz1MDBM)\n\n> A recent purchase of a raffle ticket. Easy, and hopefully mine in a week...\n\n![](youtube:OfdaDy3nz9o)\n\n> Personal stash that you must visit to deposit and collect anything you buy or find\n\nHere's a quick tip: make sure that, before leaving your private stash area, you enter the room next to yours that has a book on the bed for a nice surprise. I then left the tavern and was greeted by a new NPC that had...a Quest! Naturally, I skipped everything he said (I know, calm down, I got this). As I suspected, the quest requirements appeared on the lower right-hand side of the game screen: 'Complete any dungeon.' Get some!\n\nI started to head out, but then a player with a dragon following him ran by me. I stopped in my tracks and followed him, admiring this fun pet that was all-too familiar from past games. Where did this impressive beast come from? And, more importantly, how do I get one?\n\nI decided to enter the chat, unsure if anyone would even acknowledge me. I quickly realized this community was welcoming, encouraging, and constantly giving each other tips. My question was answered right away, and followed-up with a barrage of tips and tricks other players had learned.\n\nHaving my answer and then some, I stopped by the marketplace, purchased a pet dragon, hit the stash, equipped my new companion and headed to the dungeons. I was officially ready for my rematch!\n\n## The Only Way Back is Forward\n\nI reached the dungeon selection cave and started Level One again. Here we go. The same settings were in play, but an entirely new dungeon layout appeared thanks to the randomly generated environments built into the game. Cautiously, I moved deeper into the dungeon. Keeping my distance, I cleared room after room, sustaining only minor damage.\n\nIt was then that I noticed something amazing— my dragon was actively seeking out destructibles that sometimes contained gold or loot drops, and collecting them for me! Corners containing vases or boxes that I couldn't see were revealed as my pet charged, broke and sometimes collected from each one. This was something I had been completely unaware of until now. If you're going to play this game, get yourself a pet! Some types are very limited in supply, so act now to avoid disappointment!\n\nAnyway, I reached the final room and found a large chest along with a few boxes. While I opened the chest, my pet did its thing, and I proceeded through the exit and back to town. I had completed the quest and was awarded a green bow that deals **twice** the damage of the one I had been using. I quickly equipped it and re-entered the cave. I know my stuff now...I am the Destroyer!\n\nI tried to enter a Level One dungeon and was denied since my item rating was too high. Obviously that would be the case, and without thinking, I started dungeon Level Two. I opened the door and was greeted by entirely new (as well as larger and more menacing) enemies. I managed to kill them quickly with my bow, but they had seriously whittled down my Health. ***Oh no!***\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oAA4EnI.jpg)\n\n> Not the same scenario, but a similar Health situation, this time with more at stake: my bow...\n\nI had barely cleared 3 rooms, and was under 1,000 HP. Desperately, I turned back to the entrance. With no way out, I remembered, 'you need to find an exit, or you lose your items' (or item, in my case). Nevertheless, my situation was dire— I was going to die. So I accepted my fate and, like the 'Light Brigade,' blundering and proud, marched into the next room and was immediately consumed by my enemies...\n\n## My Last Lost Relic\n\nI respawned in the usual place in town. Quickly scanning my equipment bar, I realized— I had lost my first item of value, just moments after acquiring it. This deepened my understanding of just how seriously prepared you need to be before entering a dungeon. Even at low levels I can now easily complete, I bring more than enough food in anticipation of worst-case scenarios. If you die, you won't technically lose your starting Uncommon weapons, but you will lose your equipment item used to harvest specific resources in each dungeon. That is, if you have one.\n\nA cool trick I learned for practically unlimited free food is to head to the general store and buy four pots, each costing 1 gold. Then head to the well adjacent to it and fill each pot with water. Next, head to the alchemy station at the windmill and move south to the flour sacks, grabbing 4 of them. Finally, go to the cooking station and attempt to create 4 loaves of bread. You can refill the pots and grab more free flour to repeat this process. Boom. Food stocks means surviving dungeons...usually.\n\nMy journey with *Lost Relics* has only just begun. I played enough to unlock player rewards and have hours of dungeons completed at this point. This is by far my favorite Blockchain game I have played to-date and the one I've spent the most time with.\n\nI've learned tons of things from the community and game. If you want to see more in-depth information on *Lost Relics,* check out our video on [MSQ Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjqDD3L3HjOTFRdc9H_-Pig) where I dive deeper into explaining the basics as well as specific strategies, future plans, and community chatter.\n\nSo if you're a dungeon crawler like me, sign up now or wait for the Beta. Either way, make sure you join the adventure that is NFT hunting in *Lost Relics*. I hope to see you out there soon. You know the name, and I will always try to help. Happy hunting adventurers!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2NAxVEI.jpg)",

        "body": "***NFTs are everywhere, and while many question their utility and value, it's evident that they're here to stay. However, what is it about Non-Fungible Tokens that has so many people scrambling to buy as many as they possibly can? The psychology of modern humans is highly nuanced, but nevertheless, a careful analysis should shed some light on the matter...***\n\nNFTs burst into mainstream culture this summer, and in spite of doubts that they’d be the next crypto trend to fade into obscurity after fifteen minutes of fame, it's safe to say their relevance will persist into the fall and beyond.\n\nThe collections that have caught most people’s attention have done so with their prices— [Cryptopunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), [Bored Apes](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/) and [Pudgy Penguins](https://www.pudgypenguins.io/#/) amassed sales incomprehensible to anyone outside of the crypto space, and even to many inside of it. With their popularity has come speculation as to why they hold value in the first place. The answer to this question can shed light on the future of the cryptocurrency space as a whole, and even the humanity of the people interacting with it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EhssBVh.jpg)\n\n> He may be cute, but with a floor price of 2.25 ETH, Pudgy Penguins is currently one of the top NFT projects in the cryptosphere\n\n## Digital Prestige\n\nAs someone who’s been observing the NFT space for the past year, there’s one value proposition that NFTs undoubtedly deliver— *prestige*. Look no further than the 10,000 unit PFP trend as evidence.\n\nThe utility of owning a Bored Ape, for example, goes beyond seeing its image in your OpenSea dashboard. In the cryptocurrency community, owning an expensive NFT gives you clout and popularity where it matters most— Twitter. A Bored Ape profile picture will lead to a massive follower boost overnight, and even owning a cheaper NFT from an up-and-coming community like [Lazy Lions](https://www.lazylionsnft.com/) or [SupDucks](https://www.supducks.com/) can boost your engagement. The idea of celebrity status has always been in the context of its domain, and as our culture continues to live more and more online, for some, having status on Twitter becomes more important than in the physical world.\n\nThe trend of NFT profile pictures taps into some of the deepest instincts we possess as humans— the desire for social status and hierarchy. Even in communities like Crypto Twitter, where anonymity plays a central role, these instincts take center stage.\n\nThe extrapolation many make, of course, is to the metaverse. In a world without physical representations of status and wealth, how will people show off social status? Many believe that NFTs are the beginning of a digital class divide.\n\n## The Allure of Fine Art\n\nWhen explaining the concept of an NFT to someone outside the crypto space, many use the comparison to art. Yes, it’s just a JPEG, but it’s *my* JPEG. We’ve all heard the line about printing out a picture of the [Mona Lisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa), but I believe that the comparison between NFTs and fine art is more complex than physicality.\n\n![](twitter:day25/status/1439825974204325888)\n\nNFTs are no longer just a rival to fine art from a conceptual standpoint. With sales from venerable auction houses like Christie’s and Sotheby’s, they stand next to, and even above, traditional paintings that sell for millions of dollars and are stored in private art collections.\n\nNFTs possess the allure of fine art foremost because of the narratives behind them. Take Cryptopunks as an example. In 2017, before anyone really knew about NFTs or the power they would one day hold over us, the CryptoPunks were created merely as an experiment. Initially given away for free, they’re now selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars, because they capture a moment in history impossible to replicate years later.\n\nFor the same reason a Picasso can have value because of the era it was created in, the value of a Punk extends beyond its visual appeal. After all, the price of fine art is not determined by a consensus on how nice it would look to hang on the wall. It’s determined by the notoriety of its artist, the sales of their other works, and its rarity in context. The same criteria holds true for NFTs.\n\n## Understanding the Pushback\n\nThis exploration of NFTs and their value has been tinctured with optimism, but there are definitely viable concerns about the future of the space. The most threatening aspect of the current NFT market is the desire for profit, and collections that neither the creators, buyers nor sellers enter with intentions beyond making a quick buck. If NFTs are to hold value in the long-term, they need to be made with utility and authenticity in mind. Some collections are doing a great job of this, but the ones that aren’t are really hurting the space.\n\nThe volatility of NFTs makes it distinct from holding value in the same way fine art does. I’d sleep better at night owning a [Van Gogh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh) than an equivalent amount of Fidenzas, for reasons obvious enough I don’t need to state them. As the space continues to mature, however, I think that volatility will be mitigated for the more established projects, and buying into an NFT community won’t have the risk of crashing in the same way it does today.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Q9Qppdh.gif)\n\n> Well, it's a little more complicated than that...\n\nUltimately, the reason many people discredit NFTs as valuable is because they are a departure from the familiar. When we think about indicators of status, our minds jump to fancy sports cars, waterfront properties, and Rolex watches. In the same way that cryptocurrency is disrupting the world of traditional finance, NFTs are redefining the way our online presence can hold social status. While their longevity has yet to be determined, the idea of digitized hierarchy is undoubtedly here to stay.",

So, without further ado, today we bring you Abracadabra.Money!***\n\n## Alakazam, Alakazoo!\n\nThere's nothing quite like the mystic arts and the power of crypto, and there's no debating the fact that we love magic internet money. Ah yes, is there anything more enrapturing and spellbinding than the ever-evolving world of Blockchain tech? I guess with NFTs, DeFi and new Blockchain-based games, we all feel like wizards (or warlocks, or sorceresses...you get the drift) at the best of times. Sure, we might not have long gray beards or help Hobbits and Dwarves out with their quests against a Dark Lord trapped in an enchanted Ring, but we sure know how to generate a good yield (hopefully).\n\n[Abracadabra.Money](https://abracadabra.money/) is a DeFi project that *literally* allows you to produce Magic Internet Money (MIM). It's no longer a goof guys, we have finally reached the apex of our memes. In all seriousness though, Abracadabra.Money actually acts as a 'Spellbook,' thus making its users 'Spellcasters.' As such, you can provide collateral in the form of several interest bearing cryptoassets including yvYFI, yvUSDT, yvUSDC, xSUSHI and more. Users are then able to borrow Magic Internet Money (MIM), a stablecoin that can be swapped for any other traditional stablecoin.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hIqvwUj.png)\n\n> That about summarizes it...\n\nOnce users are done conjuring, the spell is easily reversed by returning the conjured MIMs to the Spellbook. Once this is complete, the magically locked interest bearing tokens are released...simple as that! It's nothing even the least experienced of Druids can't handle.\n\nWhat's also great about Abracadabra.Money is that you can select between five different networks including [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain), [Fantom](https://fantom.foundation/), [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/) and [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/). This multi-chain approach makes Abracadabra.Money far more versatile and attractive to users since they are not at the mercy of any one platform, allowing for greater uptake and easier control over their DeFi experience.\n\n## What Services Does Abracadabra.Money Offer?\n\nWithout getting in to too much detail, the following services are offered by Abracadabra.Money:\n\n- **Borrowing** using Kashi Lending Technology\n- **Farming** whereby users deposit LP tokens to farm SPELL tokens\n- **Staking** whereby SPELL tokens are staked for sSPELL\n- **MIM-3POOL** that allows users to provide liquidity to the MIM-3LP3CRV pool\n- **Swapping** using curve.fi which allows users to swap their MIM stable coins for USDT, DAI, or USDC\n- **Bridging** MIM tokens directly on Abracadabra's interface thanks to [Anyswap Network](https://anyswap.exchange/#/router)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JdxhL1a.png)\n\n> DeFi Dragons emulate Smaug and covet (digital) gold above all else\n\n## What Sorcery is This!?\n\nHaving only been around for what seems like a couple of months, Abracadabra.Money has managed to garner a pretty sizable following on their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MIM_Spell) account, and judging by some of the material I've seen on YouTube, some users seem to think Abracadabra.Money, and MIM token in particular, is truly magic! In fact, according to [Crypto Mischief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7a_Jztq7Lc&t=19s), he swears that MIM is 'the future of DeFi.'\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qqIaupW.png)\n\n> Yes, Magic Woosh Kitty, I doez\n\nWith a straightforward interface, novel approach and growing community, Abracadabra.Money seems like a real player in the DeFi space. Be sure to check their protocol out and follow them on their various social media pages. Until next time crypto fans!\n\n> For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) on SubStack, and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar) on Twitter.\n\n*We will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) every Friday at 3PM EST.

I have to say, I'm loving all these spooky Halloween projects entering into the mix...after all, it is my favorite time of year! 🦇 Sneaky Vampire Syndicate is a collection of 8,888 unique Vampires residing in *The Lair*, a place all Vampires call home— existing in the Metaverse, far from the searing light of day and infernal Vampire Hunters! All Sneaky Vampires live on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain as ERC-721 tokens. \n\nEvery Vampire holder will be eligible to claim a free Bat companion. Bats are the exclusive companions of Syndicate members, and they should be flying in around mid-October.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/E9RqSWT.png)\n\n> [The Birthday Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birthday_Party_(band)) wrote a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J8Ygt_t69A) about this...\n\nThe artwork and design featured in this project is simply scintillating! The Vampires look suave, debonair and stylish with their slicked back hair, perfect smiles and Transylvanian sensibilities. The project's designer is the exceptionally skillful [Mig](https://twitter.com/migwashere2) who, incidentally, also contributed design work for [The Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/). Fantastic!\n\nLet's take a look at some of these suckers (Get it? Because fangs...Vampires...yeah, I know)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6Vf992C.png)\n\n> Roaring Twenties anyone?

        "body": "***Join us as we take a look at our Discovery of the Day! Whether it's their incredible artwork, vibrant communities or the awesome features planned for their projects, there's sure to be something here that'll grab you. Today we bring you Skullx!***\n\n## From the Depths of Hell\n\nFrom cute cartoon cats and dogs to frightening renderings of ghosts and ghouls, the sheer diversity of styles and collections within the world of NFTs is growing on a daily basis. It's clear that Non-Fungible Tokens are here to stay and that several communities forming around these provably rare collections of digital art are truly committed to supporting (and holding on to) the pieces created by innovative and talented digital artists from around the world.\n\nToday's Discovery of the Day falls into the darker side of the NFT spectrum—[Skullx](https://skullxnft.io/) is a series of collections of digital skulls and outlandish creatures that inhabit the murky underworld of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain.\n\nNow again, I said Skullx is a series of 'collections,' not just one single collection. The first generation of Skullx NFTs belong to the [Skullx: Origins](https://opensea.io/collection/kinkyskullx) collection (otherwise known as 'KinkySkullx'). There are exactly 666 of these colorfully demented, hand generated skulls in existence, and the vast majority of them already have owners. At time of writing, this collection has a floor price of 0.99 ETH, so if you want to get your hands on one, head over to their OpenSea page right now. As an added bonus, holding a Skullx: Origins piece grants you access to a free mint. Check out a sample of this collection below:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AdwPjgr.jpg)\n\n> Greg really wasn't happy with the new marketing direction, but at least sales were up from last Quarter...\n\nThen there's [Skullx: Aeons](https://opensea.io/collection/skullx-aeons). The second generation of Skullx NFTs, Aeons has a suitably more developed backstory and draws from the cosmic horror stylings of notable authors such as [H.P. Lovecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft) and [Thomas Ligotti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Ligotti).\n\nConsisting of some 2,000 pieces, these primordial beings have existed since time immemorial. Denizens of far-flung dimensions, they have spent countless millennia wandering across the Netherverse, protecting their domains and eliminating any who oppose their superiority. Up until recently, these terrifying giants have remained inert in a deep slumber, but disturbances from a troubled past have roused them from their long rest. As such, the fallen Aeons of the Old World have freed themselves from the confines of the Nether and are hungry to reclaim that which was once theirs. At time of writing, Skullx: Aeons has a floor price of 0.26 ETH. Gaze into the eyes of his specimen, if you dare:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iRhsnZ6.jpg)\n\n> This actually reminds me of [SCP-3000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmEZ-zqbswg) (otherwise known as Anantashesha), though I think this gargantuan 'Summoner' is way more terrifying!\n\nNow I'd also like to draw your attention to this very limited edition of Skullx NFTs, or rather a collaborative effort, [MechNuggets x Skullx](https://opensea.io/collection/mechnuggets-x-kinkyskullx). Consisting of eight 3D Mech Skullx summoned from Hell, this expertly rendered collection currently has a floor price of 0.88 ETH. Also, every Skullx: Aeons piece acts as a mint pass, so make sure that, if you own one, you use it before the public sale opens! Here's my favorite piece from the collection:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/glSUBeo.png)\n\n> If the creator(s) of this piece isn't a [Megadeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megadeth) fan, then I don't know...\n\nThe artist behind Skullx is '[666](https://twitter.com/Skullx_666).' Yes, that's literally all I can tell you, but their NFTs are diabolically delightful, if I do say so myself...\n\n## What's Next for Skullx?\n\nI'm glad you asked, because the next collection, **Skullx: 10k**, is due for release sometime in October. As you may have guessed, this new crop consists of 10,000 Skullx that will soon be summoned as ERC-721 tokens to fight for and protect their realms. The lore reveals that a looming darkness of the past, yet to be fully revealed, will change the fate of all. Ominous!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Zs05Bvi.gif)\n\n> I gotta get my mitts on one of these bad boys!\n\nAs for the Roadmap, well, it's not super detailed, but it looks like airdrops, a migration of the Pixel Skullx Contract, the 1st utility of Aeons and the establishment of a SkullxDAO are all on the cards. See for yourself:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qWh69TO.png)\n\n> Nothing wrong with pragmatism!\n\n## Statistics\n\nGiven that Skullx consists of a few collections, the following stats apply to Skullx: Origins.\n\n* **Total Items** - 476/666\n* **Owners** - 137\n* **Floor Price** - 0.99 ETH\n* **Volume Traded** - 161 ETH\n\nThe collection is currently sold out, but you can view Skullx: Origins over here on their [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/kinkyskullx) page. You can also check out [Skullx: Aeons](https://opensea.io/collection/skullx-aeons), [Skullx: Editions](https://opensea.io/collection/skullx-editions) and [MechNuggets x Skullx](https://opensea.io/collection/mechnuggets-x-kinkyskullx) if you'd like to find out more about each individual collection.\n\nAs a fan of darker stuff and Metal, I gotta tell ya, Skullx really floats my boat. With a super active team, growing community and a sick new collection about to drop, Skullx is definitely an NFT project you'll want to follow closely. Have your wallet at the ready so you don't miss out on the next mint!

Whether it's their art, their vibrant communities, or the unique features planned for their projects, there is definitely something here that will catch your eye. Today we bring you Paladin Pandas!**_\n\n## Paladin Panda-monium!\n\n[Paladin Pandas](https://www.paladinpandas.com) is a gamified collection of 10,000 unique ERC-1155 NFTs on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) Blockchain. These playable paladins are hand-drawn and feature over 150 programmatically generated traits across 6 classes and 9 categories. Each panda has its own background story and is ready for battle.\n\nLegend has it, these pandas were bamboo-zled by the old gods. With their home planet destroyed and forced to rebuild, the Panda Elders entrusted only the most elite panda warriors with the task of retrieving their most sacred resource—Bambooniums. The Paladin Pandas travel space scavenging, mining, and raid boss farming, ready to fight for glory!\n\n### Intergalactic Gamification\n\nOne way to battle for rewards is a rogue-like game called, 'Space Expedition' where every adventure is a random map that pits your pandas against evil invaders for a chance to win Bambooniums and other exciting prizes, which is promised to include some very high-profile NFTs! The game is still in development, but the paladin engineering team just released their updated Space Expedition whitepaper to include some pand-tastic new details!\n\nClick the image below or visit [https://shrtco.de/🐼🎮📃](https://shrtco.de/🐼🎮📃) to learn more!\n\n<a href=\"https://shrtco.de/🐼🎮📃\">\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/f2XVNzV/mosaic-cover.jpg)\n\n</div>\n</a>\n\n### Features\n\n* **Asian Inspired & Created** - All Paladin Pandas are carefully crafted by experienced and highly skilled Asian artists\n* **Play-2-Earn** - There are six classes with different skills and an assortment of weapons to choose from\n* **Community First** - Community contributors are rewarded regularly, and numerous community activities and airdrops are currently being planned\n* **Full Ownership** - When you mint a Paladin Panda, you get the full commercial rights to it, so you can reproduce, sell and do pretty much anything you want with it\n* **Wildlife Protection** - A portion of all proceeds received will be donated to animal protection charities for Pandas as well as other endangered wild animals\n\n### Rarity\n\nSome important things to know while building your collection are that rareness and diversity play critical roles in ensuring a successful battle and, consequently, your ability to earn rewards. For instance, having pandas from 3 different classes gives you special in-game advantages (or 'BUFFS,' for the initiated). The more classes you hold, the more skills and positionings you can use, the more enemies you can defeat!\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/tbZsfH6/paladin-pandas.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n----<br>Yeah...did you catch that?<br>There's even a freaking hoverboard! 🤯\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://media2.giphy.com/media/RgbveF92uzZLnBcUQk/giphy.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n* **Fur**\n  * Golden (0.2%)\n  * Alien (1%)\n  * Zombie (3%)\n  * Leopard (6%)\n  * Quick Silver (6%)\n  * Panda (≈83.8%)\n* **Class**\n  * Commando (≈16.7%)\n  * CyberBard (≈16.7%)\n  * Engineer (≈16.7%)\n  * Main Tank (≈16.7%)\n  * Medic (≈16.7%)\n  * Sniper (≈16.7%)\n* **Background**\n  * Graffiti (≈0.6%)\n  * Bamboo (≈1%)\n  * Aquamarine (≈5.8%)\n  * Coral (≈5.8%)\n  * Spring (≈5.8%)\n  * Orange (≈5.8%)\n\n> Note that some of the rarest traits include the Graffiti and Bamboo backgrounds as well as Golden, Zombie, Alien, Leopard, and QuickSilver furs.

Provably rare **JPEGs** of cute, tiny animals of course!\n\nThese indisputably kawaii Axolittles are a collection of 10,000 algorithmically generated pieces of adorable art living in the ocean of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain. Each Axolittle is made up from a random selection of over 160 unique traits. An intriguing feature of the Axolittles is that every single one is fully animated! Yes, the team uses [After Effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_After_Effects) and an ingenious implementation of some custom code to achieve this. Astounding!\n\nThe artist behind this delightful project is Miniyami, whose favorite thing to draw is...you guessed it: axolotls!

Whether it's their incredible artwork, vibrant communities or the awesome features planned for their projects, there's definitely something here to capture your imagination! Today we bring you Frontier!***\n\n## The Path of The Watcher\n\nSent on a secret mission along with a fleet of ships, an enigmatic traveler known only as 'The Watcher S/N 404' soon finds himself alone and lost in the far reaches of space after a mysterious incident occurs. To make matters worse, The International Space Security Administration (ISSA) knows he isn't dead and plans to eliminate him in order to hide the truth...\n\nEnter the world of [Frontier](https://www.missingfrontier.com/), an online Play-to-Earn Battle Royale and our Discovery of the Day! Now the story of The Watcher isn't being decided by any central entity—in fact, you can follow [The Watcher](https://twitter.com/missingwatcher) right now on Twitter and participate in the fully interactive story to help make decisions that will determine the ultimate outcome of our hero's journey! There's also an animated series of Frontier in the works based on The Watcher's universe! Best of all, every single collector will feature in the lore! How awesome is that?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/E6EGrtI.png)\n\n> I get such strong [Dead Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Space_(video_game)) vibes from this and I love it!\n\nSo where do I even start with a project as awesome and ambitious as Frontier? Well, let's talk a little about The Watchers themselves who are the heroes of Frontier. Each of them comes with $DATA Utility Tokens, in-game Hero Skins, in-game Sector Skins and Priority in-game Queues. They are available in both digital and physical editions, and soon players will be able to interact with them in Augmented Reality (AR). Check out some of the (now sold out) Watchers below:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JiFlNRD.jpg)\n\n> This Aqua Watcher looks like he's ready to go scuba diving...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hsQRGlS.jpg)\n\n> The Savage Watcher likes hanging around in public bathrooms at night\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8QnBv0P.jpg)\n\n> Minimalism is the key to this Black Watcher's signature style\n\nDon't worry, more Watchers will be available for purchase soon. Until then, head over to [Rarible](https://rarible.com/missingwatcher?tab=created) to see what you can pick up there...that is, if any owners are willing to part with their Watchers!\n\n## The Mechanics of Frontier\n\nOK, so I'm gonna do my best to explain a couple of the mechanics and items that players will be able to purchase and use within the Frontier universe. Here goes:\n\n**The Black Box** - This is a limited edition, non-playable utility NFT. Every player that holds a Black Box on a given date will receive The Data Key. In addition, those players that hold The Black Box *and* a Watcher NFT on a certain date will receive the 'Stellar Edition' of The Data Key. Players will be able to open their Black Box and mint two random Flash Blocks of any rarity tier. Conversely, players may choose to keep their Black Box which will lead to something completely different occurring. Until such time, players are advised to 'keep safe and stay tuned' as everything will be revealed in due course.\n\n‍![](https://i.imgur.com/wxCvFz4.png)\n\n> Take note that Black Box Series One is **sold out**. If you want to grab one, head over to [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/frontiergame) and purchase one for about 1.6 ETH (this is subject to change of course)\n\n**Flash Blocks** - These consist of weapons, shields, traps and hacks. In essence, these are abilities players can employ on the battlefield. Regardless of whether players are attacking or defending a sector, they will have the opportunity to use three Flash Blocks, each of which has a different effect that can dramatically alter the final outcome of a battle. Take note that all Flash Blocks have a short cooldown once they have been used. There are three different types of Flash Blocks:\n\n- *Attack* - These Flash Blocks can be deployed to devastate your enemies or, at the very least, severely impede them\n- *Defense* - Under heavy fire? Defense Flash Blocks help you withstand even the most punishing attacks from your opponents\n- *Glitch* - These are the ultimate weapons for players to exploit. They are far more powerful than standard Flash Blocks and therefore have a much longer cooldown time. They also happen to be the only blocks players can directly collect that have a guaranteed rarity. As such, Glitch Blocks are only available for purchase in The Glitch page for a limited 24 hour period\n\n**The Data Keys** - These are non-playable utility NFTs that guarantee premium advantages. Data Keys give players special access to drops and NFTs as well as the alpha version of Frontier. In addition, Data Keys grant players the right to cast votes and even create proposals. Finally, Data Keys allow players to redeem $DATA, Frontier's Utility Token. Data Keys are issued to all players that retain ownership of a Frontier NFT. Moreover, dedicated supporters receive a 'Stellar Edition' of The Data Key, granting them access to special airdrops and exclusive in-game items.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tMBA1q2.jpg)\n\n> Access card or key? How about a Data Key?\n\n## So What's Next for Frontier?\n\nThere's a lot going on in the Frontier camp, but a close look at their website reveals that Leaderboards, Flash Blocks, Glitch Blocks, 'The Synthesis,' Heroes and even Avatars are all currently in development. If you want to learn more about what the team has planned, I implore you to check out their [Roadmap](https://www.missingfrontier.com/frontier-roadmap).\n\nYou can also find out more about the game and its mechanics on Frontier's [About page](https://www.missingfrontier.com/about).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jtXc0LG.png)\n\n> Season One of Frontier begins soon! You don't want to miss this!\n\n## Allow Me to Crunch the Numbers\n\nFrontier's a pretty unique project—it's a Blockchain-based game, it's Augmented Reality, it's got NFTs and an already impressive community...need I go on? Check out some of Frontier's stats below:\n\n* **100% Custom** - ‍Everything is minted and generated under Frontier's custom smart contracts\n* **The Black Box Series One** - These are officially *sold out*, and Frontier will *never* sell them again\n* **3,000 Available Keys** - $DATA Utility Tokens (ERC-20) will be distributed to all Frontier NFT holders\n\nAgain, pretty much everything on Frontier is currently sold out, but you can view items on their [Rarible](https://rarible.com/missingwatcher?tab=created) and/or [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/frontiergame) pages.\n\nAnd in terms of their 'traditional' stats, well, Frontier currently boasts the following on their OpenSea:\n\n- **Items** - 2\n- **Owners** - 2.1K\n- **Floor Price** - 0.27 ETH\n- **Volume Traded** - 4K\n\nI think I could go on about Frontier all day, so I'll leave you with this instead—with so much going on, and so much time, effort and care being put into this incredibly stylish and energetic Blockchain-based project, can you really afford to miss out on such a golden opportunity? Make the right choice and follow Frontier on all their social media pages without hesitation! Until then...I'll see you on the Battlefield!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/preq2Ah.png)\n\n> For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) on SubStack, and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar) on Twitter.\n\n*We will be hosting giveaways for eligible members on the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) every Friday at 3PM ET.

Whether it's their art, vibrant communities, or the unique features planned for their projects, there is definitely something here that'll be to your liking! Today we bring you Metaverse Travel Agency!***\n\n## Traversing the Boundless Metaverse\n\nIt's Monday! You know what that means, right? A brand new week full of Discoveries of the Day here at MSQ, and man do we have some awesome projects to show you this week. As the Metaverse evolves, it's only a matter of time before we end up like everybody in the movie [Ready Player One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One_(film)). I don't know about you, but when I'm in the Metaverse, I want to be the pinnacle of *swag.* Well...[Metaverse Travel Agency](https://themta.io/) may be the key to unlocking maximum drip 🔑\n\nMetaverse Travel Agency (or MTA) brings something fresh to the NFT space. So what if you could actually *wear* your NFT in the Metaverse? MTA is pioneering the next generation of wearable NFTs on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. Their first collection consists of 10,101 randomly assembled Metahelmets, each of which is entirely unique. However, some are rarer than others. They are shaped from over 100 possible traits with each helmet including **The Quantum Machine**. As an added bonus, each Metahelmet is equipped with a screen that allows users to display other NFTs they own directly on the helmet.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cqs9nKK.gif)\n\n> Walking around with a $100k Ape on your helmet? Living life on the edge...I like it!\n\nAlongside **The Quantum Machine** owning a helmet includes special membership benefits, such as NFT gated access to the Metaverse headquarters and quests, 3D files (glb), ownership and commercial usage rights for the NFT and much more coming in the roadmap. Metaverse Travel Agency is also partnered with [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) and [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/) meaning the helmets will be specially optimized to be worn in each Metaverse.\n\n## What's in Store for Metanauts?\n\nOnce you purchase a Metahelmet, there are five roles you can assume as a Metanaut:\n\n1. **Architect** - These highly sought after Metanauts are capable of building impossible structures with their tools. \n2. **Hacker** - Extremely difficult to find, these Metanauts deploy software and solve critical technical problems as part of their primary function.\n3. **Guardian** - These are the protectors of all members of the Metaverse. They uphold the rules and ensure MTA members are treated with respect and courtesy.\n4. **Explorer** - These Metanauts have visited every corner of the known Metaverse and constantly seek to expand its boundaries. They are responsible for uncovering new quests and solving intricate puzzles.\n5. **Academicians** - The first point of contact for initiates in the virtual world, Academicians help and guide users on everything there is to know about the Metaverse including its assets and people.\n\nThe Metaverse Travel Agency has a bright future with an action-packed Roadmap which includes items like a Community Wallet, Community Adventures, Development of the MTA Headquarters, Exclusive Merchandise, Exclusive Events, Giveaways and so much more. \n\nCheck out the full Roadmap below 👇\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/s7siqjQ.png)\n\n## Sounds Rad! Where Can I Get One?\n\nYou can get your hands on these remarkable Metahelmets on October 7th. Join MTA's [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/h3JKVavUSA) for more information on the release.

Whether it's their unique artwork, energetic communities or the amazing features planned for their projects, there's no doubt that something here will tickle your fancy. Today we bring you Woodies!***\n\n## The Magical Forest Dwellers of Wondermist\n\nNature—as modern humans, many of us have lost our intrinsic connection with the natural world. The advent of modern medicine coupled with an ever increasing level of global interconnectedness (among other factors) has, in many respects, separated us from Nature. We are nowhere near as fragile as we used to be, and no single other predator or creature is able to oppose our intellect and capacity to innovate. But the truth is that we are indeed part of the very Nature we have sought to dominate and arbitrarily exploit to suit our every want and need. Our world is fragile, and thus, we are as well.\n\nPerhaps this is what makes today's Discovery of the Day particularly special—an awareness and understanding that, in order to make the world better, we need to give more to one another and replace what we have taken from Nature.\n\n### The Story of Arden and the Evil Logger\n\nLong ago, when the world was a purer, freer place, a tribe of magical trees lived, laughing and playing together in peace and harmony. But then, one terrible night, the trees were cut down and hauled away by a nefarious antagonist known only as 'The Logger.' By some providence, a solitary tree by the name of Arden was left untouched. Without hesitation, he knew exactly what needed to be done—Arden steeled his resolve and decided to uncover the location of the evil Logger and rescue his friends from his grimy clutches! Now our hero finds himself on an epic journey fraught with peril, but one he must nevertheless undertake if he ever hopes to recover his lost kin and restore the forest to its former glory.\n\nWoodies is a collection of 10,000 avatars created by [UltraDAO](https://ultradao.org/). However, Woodies isn't simply another avatar project—driven by one of the biggest 10k project teams along with an established artist DAO, Woodies' underlying story and characters have both substance and ultimately serve a higher purpose. Future content will be be highly developed with an emphasis on offering meaningful rewards to collectors. Woodies exist as ERC-721 token on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain while all data is hosted on [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) (IPFS).\n\nEvery single Woodie is entirely unique and randomly generated at the time of mint from more than 900 possible traits including eyes, hats, clothing, masks and so on. In the near future, a separate collection of hand-drawn Core Characters from the Woodies universe, including the lead protagonist Arden, will be available for purchase and trading. These special characters will be provided at random to anyone holding a Woodies Mint Passport. So now with all of the integral stuff covered, let's check out some of these colorful woodland characters:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nM4wk7V.png)\n\n> I wonder what Pokémon Gym this Woodie belongs to?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dh4dltn.png)\n\n> A bird on the head is worth two in the bush...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SU9zBwn.png)\n\n> Wilhelmina's hairstylist is well-paid for a reason\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Woodies is more than just an NFT project. The team has entered into a partnership with [Trees for the Future](https://trees.org/) and committed to planting 1 million trees in sub-Saharan Africa. The latest update indicates that Woodies has donated 73.824 ETH thus far, allowing for more than 837,000 trees to be planted. It looks like they're already close to their goal and may well surpass it—it's refreshing to see an NFT project looking to change the world for the better. You can find out more about this monumental passport [here](https://trees.org/post/woodiesnft/).\n\n## Blazing a Trail to Prosperity\n\nWoodies actually has an extensive Roadmap (or 'Trail Guide') spanning several months and three distinct phases. For the sake of brevity, we'll briefly summarize Woodies' current trajectory:\n\n**Phase 1 - 10K Woodies** - This phase should take place over the course of Fall/Winter 2021. Events and items listed under this initial stage include The Nameless Woodies (Challenges), Woodies Goodies (Merch), Woodies Comic (Airdrop), One Million Trees Campaign (Giving Back), and Woodies Lore (Exclusive Artwork).\n\n**Phase 2 - Woodies World** - Due to take place over the course of early 2022, this phase includes Woodies 3D (Metaverse), Woodies World (also Metaverse), and Woodies Comic (Airdop).\n\n**Phase 3 - Woodies Membership** - Taking place from mid-to-late 2022, this phase encompasses Woodies Weekends (Members Only), Woodies Kids Club (also Members Only), and Additional Content (Extras).\n\nThe full 'Trail Guide' can be viewed on Woodies' [official site](https://woodiesnft.com/).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5ltW4h7.png)\n\n> Arden, the main protagonist in the Woodies universe\n\n## Statistics\n\nWoodies is still a relatively new project but has gained a lot of traction in the past few months. Moreover, its growing following and active team bode well for the future. You can grab yourself a *Woodie* right now via [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/woodies-generative). See below for stats:\n\n* **Total Items** - 4.8k\n* **Owners** - 2K\n* **Floor Price** - 0.25 ETH\n* **Volume Traded** - 1K ETH\n\nMint passports are currently sold out, but you can purchase one on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/woodies-mint-passport). Stats for *Mint Passports* are as follows:\n\n* **Total Items** - 3\n* **Owners** - 2K\n* **Floor Price** - 0.44 ETH\n* **Volume Traded** - 2.5K ETH\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pdtn0t8.png)\n\nWoodies is dedicated to sustainability, environmental awareness and building a better world.

They are programmatically generated from over 160 traits with 3,676,470 possible combinations and primed to take over the metaverse.\n\nThis howlingly hardcore collection goes well beyond just looking dope AF (As Fang) though. From collaborations to daily giveaways, charitable donations, NFTx liquidity pools, a merch store, and more, Fang Gang is, by far, one of _the_ most active and impressive projects we've come across. We can't possibly cover it all in one article, but read on to see just _some_ of what this incredible community and project have to offer...\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Z6C1MDd/fang-gang.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n### Rarity\n\nEach Fang Gang NFT possesses a unique personality with each combination of traits being either Common, Uncommon, Rare, or Mythic. Some are rarer than others, but all fit for members of the Fang Gang. In addition, some Fangsters are special 1/1 editions, meaning nobody’s ever gonna bite their toes.\n\n<div style=\"width: 90%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![You’ll hear them howl in the streets at night about who’s got the most sauce.](https://i.ibb.co/ctvzhJw/fang-gang-rarity.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\n### Diamond Fangs Club\n\nEvery day, Fang Gang holders who have their holdings either delisted or listed above 1 ETH are eligible to win prizes!\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/6s0ydyH/diamond-fangs.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\n**Diamond Fangs DLC Drop**:\n\nJust this week, Diamond Fang Club members were airdropped a free [@decentraland](https://twitter.com/decentraland)-compatible outfit created by NFT artist and designer [@Michi_Todd](https://twitter.com/michi_todd).\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/BcFqCL1/diamond-fangs-dlc-drop.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 400px; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n<b>uwu</b>\n\n</div>\n\n### NFTx Liquidity Pool\n\nThe [Fang Gang NFTx.io](https://nftx.io/vault/0xebd9dc65c723cadc0ee4ee5a8013ddd3db98f250/info/) liquidity pool recently launched, allowing holders to buy, sell, or stake their Fangsters.

That’s why the Fang Gang team wants to give back part of their profits to NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) that protect and restore wildlife habitats and ecosystems. These charities are fairly chosen by community vote from a pool of candidate organizations.\n\nMost recently, 10 ETH was donated to [SeaShepherd.org](https://seashepherd.org) as well as another NGO to be selected and announced soon. These donations are made through [The Giving Block](https://thegivingblock.com/), the #1 crypto donations platform, providing verified transactions.\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/LNSZyfF/Three-Two-Pix-Teaser.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n## What's Next for Fang Gang?\n\n* **0%** - Giveaways and launch\n* **25%** - Collab Fangsters by NFT artists—auctions and exclusive drops to holders\n* **50%** - First charity donation chosen by the community\n* **75%** - ETH and NFT giveaways to holders\n* **100%** - Premium Merch Store and second charity donation chosen by the community\n\n<div style=\"width: 90%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![Fang Gang Roadmap 2.0](https://i.ibb.co/frtCzJ7/Roadmap2-0.png)\n\n</div>\n\n> A lot of our plans are long-term, so they will happen repeatedly and along the way, while we build the community and grow together. Collaboration is one of the wildest perks. Happening through exclusive airdrops for holders or special pieces auctioned within the collection, these will make Fang Gang connect with big names in the NFT community.\n>\n> Bite first, talk later. That’s our way.\n\n### PixelFangs\n\nScheduled for release in the second week of October, a new collection containing 8,888 PixelFangs will soon be made available. Each Fang Gang NFT holder will be able to mint 1 per wallet for free (plus gas, of course).\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/v1fNPxC/pixel-fangs.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\n### FangRunner\n\nAn endless runner game; evade flippers and dodge paper hands while running through New Fang City collecting diamonds.

Whether it's their art, terrific communities, or the unique features planned for their projects, there is definitely something here for you to enjoy! Today we bring you SolSnatchers!***\n\n## Solana's Skeletal Psychopomps\n\nHappy October friends! You know what that means? We get to feature a bunch of spooky projects leading up to Halloween, and today we bring you some of the most terrifying yet! [Solsnatchers](https://solsnatchers.com/) is a frightening collection of 10,000 randomly generated Grim Reapers that dwell deep within the Underworld of the [Solana](https://solana.com/) Blockchain. Every Solsnatcher is unique and grants their holders access to special events and opportunities. The Solsnatchers are created from a combination of 220 unique attributes, meaning there are over 4 million possible iterations.\n\nEach SolSnatcher serves as a key to open the digital portal to the SolUnderworld. This portal only opens once a day, and at seemingly random times. However, if a Snatcher is lucky enough to successfully open the portal, they will discover valuable mystery rewards and a token as proof of their triumphant snatch. Furthermore, this token will grant them a prestigious role in the Official SolUnderworld Discord channel.\n\nSo, let's take a peak at some of these fiendishly emaciated entities  👀\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qpTHyPI.png)\n\n> I loved this guy in [Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Ted%27s_Bogus_Journey)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LuseoEP.png)\n\n> An addiction to mumble rap and contact sports makes this SolSnatcher's eyes bleed...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MZ3CpdT.png)\n\n> The Shogunate gave out free headphones, but only on Tuesdays\n\n## What's on the Infernal Horizon for SolSnatchers?\n\nAlthough the NFTs themselves may be dead (or maybe just really hungry?) the project is very much alive! The SolSnatchers Roadmap includes many exciting events such as special giveaways, donations, the grand-opening of the portal, an epic treasure hunt and much, much more! \n\nTake a look at the full Roadmap below:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CxYOa9N.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HGVncJd.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OGAp1Yf.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4UIX2Q6.png)\n\n## Stats\n\nThe SolSnatchers collection is currently sold out, but you can still grab yourself one of these fantastically rendered Reapers on [Solanart](https://solanart.io/collections/solsnatchers).\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information:*\n\n* **Total Items** - 2,040/10,000\n* **Owners** - 1,283\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) on SubStack, and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar)* on Twitter.\n\n*We will be hosting giveaways for eligible members on the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) every Friday at 7PM UTC.

        "body": "***Join us as we take a look at our Discovery of the Day! Whether it's their impressive artwork, bustling communities or the incredible features planned for their projects, there's definitely something here just for you! Today we bring you Cryowar!***\n\n## Start a War\n\n> The realm of Solariance's history is one tainted by bloodshed and brutal conflict. With their existence teetering on the precipice, the Solarians sacrificed all they had to preserve their world and earn the favor of their Gods. Mercifully, the Armistice of Akava seemingly brought the aeons-long war to an end. The four Gods, *Sullr*, *Senemeer*, *Lavaden* and *Vigolar*, embittered and weary from fighting, ascended to their skyrealms, finally granting the people of Solariance a measure of peace.\n> \n> 10,000 years have passed, and with the Armistice long forgotten and the great oracles of Nastra and Akava mysteriously 'missing,' *Sullr* and *Vigolar* have emerged from their dreadful sleep to avenge the apparent deaths of their most worthy servants. As the enraged duo reigned terror upon Faragoan's Kingdom, *Senemeer* and *Lavaden* returned from the Astral Plane to quell their aggression. The old Armistice is indeed null and void, and growing rumblings within the Astral Plane herald the rise of new Gods eager to join in glorious battle. Welcome...to the Cryowar!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XpjW7Cq.png)\n\nIf the lore isn't enough to get you pumped up for this Discovery of the Day, then I'd wager nothing can move you. [Cryowar](https://cryowar.com/) is a next-gen Blockchain-based multiplayer game built on top of the [Solana](https://solana.com/) Ecosystem. Harnessing the power of the [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) 4 and available across several different platforms, Cryowar boasts exhilarating gameplay, crisp visuals and a rewards system that favors skill over bank balance. Yes, you read right—absolutely nothing in the Cryowar in-game store will give players any kind of competitive advantage over their opponents. In other words, everyone fights on an even playing field, and only skill will determine who moves up the ranks.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n\nAnother integral part of Cryowar's mechanics is its short match times. Battles typically last no longer than 3 minutes at a time, allowing players to participate in quick games whenever they want from virtually anywhere. Players will also find that they will need to rapidly adapt their strategies and playing styles—since Cryowar randomly cycles through a pool of level objectives at the start of every match and changes them on the fly, players can never get too comfortable or resort to gimmicks in order to succeed in battle. In short, whatever the game throws at you, be ready for it.\n\nAccording to the Cryowar site, four different game modes will form the basis of Cryowar:\n\n- **Last Man Standing** - Survive all the way to the end and vanquish your foes\n- **Deathmatch** - An all-out slugfest where everyone is your enemy\n- **Top Score in 5 Minutes** - Gain as many points as possible in 5 minutes\n- **Battle Arena** - Player versus Player where the best warrior takes the crown\n\n### Meet the Heroes of Solariance\n\nCryowar has three different classes of heroes, each with their own combat style, skills and backstory. Let's take a brief look at each now:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/v72meiR.png)\n\n> **The ACS Heavy** is a veritable walking fortress with unprecedented might and resolve, who combines ancient tactics with the unmatched fury of the Gods\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sxozHpg.png)\n\n> **The Valkyrie** is named after the mythical Norse maidens who carried the souls of worthy fallen warriors to Valhalla. Their precise and lightning-quick movements allow them to make short work of their adversaries, slashing them to ribbons in mere seconds\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EFOiNp7.png)\n\n> **The Centurion** is a Holy Warrior skilled with both sword and pistol. He righteously wields the Gods' technology, cleansing all heretics in a hailstorm of sanctimonious gunfire\n\n## The Heart and Soul of Cryowar\n\nCryowar is an ambitious project that aims high. Herewith a summary of some of its key features and most noteworthy aspects:\n\n- **Multiplayer NFT** - Cryowar is a real-time multiplayer PvP arena NFT game utilizing the Unreal Engine on the Solana Network\n- **Amalgam** - Cryowar combines the best parts of traditional gaming with the innovative features of Blockchain technology including DAO voting, NFTs and Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n- **Deflationary** - The game's ecosystem will make use of a deflationary mechanism that integrates staking with gameplay, giving RPG stakers the ability to earn better rewards by increasing their in-game skill and experience levels\n- **Multi-Blockchain Medieval Metaverse** - The ultimate goal of Cryowar is to create a Multi-Blockchain Medieval Metaverse without boundaries\n- **Game Mechanics** - Cryowar is a cross-platform multiplayer game that will eventually feature up to 8 unique character and focus on skill-based gameplay in order to reward players accordingly\n\n## What Battles Await Cryowar?\n\nSince the beginning of 2021, the team behind Cryowar has already achieved several milestones, though the Private sale from Q3 is still seemingly ongoing and the Public Sale is yet to be announced. Despite these apparent delays, Cryowar's team is still hard at work to bring the game to players sooner rather than later. The Official Release is slated for release in Q4 of 2021, so hopefully we'll all get the chance to check out some gameplay in the very near future.\n\n> Take a look at the full Roadmap available in the Cryowar [Whitepaper](https://cryowar.com/files/wp.pdf) below\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bivwSkV.png)\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **How can I join the Private sale?**\n>\n> The Private sale round is almost over and only applicable to long-term partners that can provide important strategic value to the success of the project. No presale has been announced as yet\n\n> **How can I participate in Beta testing?**\n>\n> Beta testing registration has been closed as a result of the huge number of applications that have been received. Having said this, players are urged to stick around as the team is pretty creative and may come up with several possible ways to include a wider segment of the Cryowar community\n\n> **When and how is the Public sale/IDO/ICO going to happen?**\n>\n> The IDO will be offered on several different platforms with the first being [Solanium](https://www.solanium.io/). All relevant information regarding whitelisting may be found on the official Solanium website. Further additions will be announced in due course.\n\n> **When is Official Beta testing expected to take place?**\n>\n> It is expected to occur in **Q4 of 2021** *(Note that this is subject to change without warning)*\n\n> **When will I be able to play Cryowar?**\n>\n> Cryowar is currently in its pre-launch phase. The team are fully committed to pleasing all relevant stakeholders and delivering a polished final product as soon as humanly possible\n\n## The Judgment of the Gods\n\nCryowar have certainly spent a huge amount of time developing their offering and have built up a substantial following on their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cryowar), [Telegram](https://t.me/cryowar) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CryowarDevs) pages. Good things take time, and while the team has made huge progress, there are obviously several integral components that need to be fine-tuned before anything is officially released. Be sure to follow Cryowar on their social media pages and get ready for some more amazing content very soon!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4AwM5kP.png)\n\n> For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) on SubStack, and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar) on Twitter.\n\n*We will be hosting giveaways for eligible members on the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) every Friday at 3PM ET.

We here at MSQ are all about those unforgettable nights of partying and cutting loose.

What did I tell you?\n\n[Party DJ Space Club](https://partydjspaceclub.com/) (or PDSC) is a collection of 2,000 limited edition Party Space DJs all bopping and shimmying across the dance floors of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. By purchasing one of these rare and totally happening NFTs, owners will instantly gain access to an exclusive club that offers some insanely cool benefits as well as a healthy dose of fun and income opportunities.\n\nMinting a Party DJ means that owners will be part of the most elite VIP Virtual Nightclub to ever grace the digital world! And that's not all—holders will also enjoy some special (and totally secret) rare drops as well as early access to any and all future collections. We strongly advise you to keep a lookout for the PDSC Spaceship as it gathers more awesome party animals from Earth and travels back and forth, transporting them to some of the greatest Nightclubs in the known Universe!\n\nEach one of the 2,000 Party DJs is entirely unique and derived from various traits including facial expressions, helmets, visors, spacesuits, badges and, of course, beautifully generated color backgrounds. While some might be rarer than others, the project has a revolutionary protocol to generate a crop of new (and even rarer) Party DJs using their Space Pod.\n\nSo what exactly do these Supercharged Sonic Samurais look like? Well, here's just a small sample of the freshly futuristic aficionados for your eyes to savor!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/o7X2rev.png)\n\nThis bangin' Party DJ actually belongs to our very own [Justin Renken](https://MSQ.io/users/justin)!

It covers everything from the actual NFT launch (which sold out in 10 minutes, by the way), merchandise, upgrading to Super Party DJs via the Space Pod, an official PDSC weekend EDM Event in Las Vegas, and the launch of the Moon Club virtual game! Check out all you get from becoming an owner 👇\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QmuafPR.png)\n\n> Again, the full Roadmap is available in its original form on the Party DJ Space Club [official website](https://partydjspaceclub.com/#roadmap)\n\n## Stats\n\nSadly all the Party DJs sold out real quickly, but fear not—you can head over to PDSC's [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/partydjspaceclub) and get yours right now!
