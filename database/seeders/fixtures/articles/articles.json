MSQ is the New Homepage for the Decentralized Web, so we have everything from DeFi and NFTs to Blockchain Games and Wallets for you to check out! From Monday to Friday, we bring you some of our top picks from across the cryptosphere and serve it up to you in the most fun and entertaining way imaginable! Today we feature the world's most notorious activist collective. That's right, it's _the_ legendary Pussy Riot!**_\n\n## The Motherland's Troubled Past\n\nCzar Nicholas II, Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin...there's little doubt that Mother Russia is home to a wealth of history and culture. However, much of the country's past is blood-soaked and characterized by significant amounts of human suffering. The Russian Revolution, the five-year plans for the development of the USSR under Stalin, the [Kyshtym Disaster](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kyshtym_disaster) (bet you didn't know about this one), the Chernobyl disaster (although this was actually Ukraine, it was once part of the USSR)...and that just spans the last few decades.\n\n<div style=\"width: 75%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/SbWw39p.jpg)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\nUncle Joe, as he was affectionately known, was responsible for the deaths of millions of his own people\n\n<\/div>\n\n<\/div>\n\nAfter the Cold War and the fall of communism, Boris Yeltsin became the first democratically elected leader of Russia in 1991. Eight years later, under immense pressure, Yeltsin resigned and chose [Vladimir Putin](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vladimir_Putin) as his successor. Putin served as President of Russia from 1999 to 2008 and reclaimed the position in 2012. In 2021, he still holds power. Putin has been criticized for silencing and imprisoning opponents, mismanaging the COVID-19 pandemic, vehemently opposing same-sex marriage and dismantling the rights of members of the LGBTQ+ community. As a result, many have come to see the Russian strongman as a tyrant hellbent on maintaining control and crushing dissident voices by any means necessary.\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/JbLi6L6.jpg)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\nVladimir Putin, current President of the Russian Federation\n\n<\/div>\n\n<\/div>\n\n## Straight Outta Russia\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/31pzb39\/Pussy-Riot-by-Igor-Mukhin.jpg)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n<i>Pussy Riot circa 2012 (Photo credit: [Igor Mukhin](https:\/\/twitter.com\/igormoukhin))<\/i>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<\/div>\n\nFebruary 21st, 2012\u2014Five women swaddled in long winter overcoats determinedly made their way into the [Cathedral of Christ the Saviour](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cathedral_of_Christ_the_Saviour) and ascended the pulpit. Situated along the Moscow River and just hundreds of meters from the Kremlin, this site is long considered the seat of the Russian Orthodoxy. Somewhat befitting this momentous event was the debut of [Tchaikovsky's](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky) *1812 Overture* some 130 years earlier.\n\nCoats tossed aside revealing colorful clothing and donning their signature\u2014and potentially [cat pee stained](https:\/\/youtu.be\/7xd0WlrSEik?t=2m40s)\u2014balaclavas, [Pussy Riot](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pussy_Riot) set in motion a chain of events that would lead to their imprisonment and cement them as champions of free speech.\n\nWhile dancing and singing 'Mother Mary, drive Putin away,' the five were promptly bum-rushed and escorted from the pulpit. Their 'Punk Prayer' was viewed by many as a direct attack on the Orthodox Church. [Reportedly](https:\/\/www.levada.ru\/sites\/default\/files\/2012_eng.pdf), only about 19% of Russians saw this performance as a protest against Pres. [Vladimir Putin](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vladimir_Putin) at the time.\n\nThree of the five were ultimately arrested and charged with 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred,' denied bail, and held for more than four months without a court hearing. They were subsequently sentenced to two years imprisonment in a women's labor camp.\n\n![](youtube:PN5inCayfnM)\n\nSince their release at the end of 2013, *Pussy Riot* has toured around the world and performed at major festivals including Glastonbury, Roskilde, Sziget, Riot Fest, Rock al Parque, Banksy's Dismaland, Nova Rock, and Festival of Dangerous Ideas at [The Sydney Opera House](https:\/\/www.sydneyoperahouse.com\/). Their favorite topics are gender fluidity, feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, decentralization and anti-authoritarianism and politics of self. *Pussy Riot* served as grand marshals of Toronto gay pride, and performed at Prides in Los Angeles, New York, Vienna, Stockholm, Boston, and so on.\n\n> 'Feminist, explicitly anti-Putin, protesting the banning of gay pride and the Orthodox church\u2019s support of the president...symbol of defiance in the face of freedoms lost.' - Guardian named *Pussy Riot* among the best art of the 21st century\n\n## _'This eth goes directly to buying gasoline'_\n\n[Pu$$y Riot NFTs](https:\/\/pussyriot.love) is a collection of 333 NFTs on the [Ethereum](https:\/\/ethereum.org) Blockchain.

        "body": "Join us as we take a look at our Discovery of the Day! Whether its their art, their exciting communities, or the unique things planned in their projects, there is definitely something here to grab your interest. Today we are taking a look at Luchadores NFTs. \n\n## Luchadores Leaving a Legacy \nOne of the most concerning things about a lot of the popular NFTs we see today is preservation. Will they exist a few years from now or will they point to broken links? It is a large problem and one that many newcomers to the NFT space seem to be unaware of as they continue expanding their collections. \n\nThis is something that Luchadores aimed to solve when they created their collection. Instead of pre-generated NFTs, Luchadores are randomly generiated at the time of purchase using Chainlink VRF. Chainlink VRF or Verificable Random Function is a provably-fair and verificable source of randomness designed for smart contracts. \n\nTherefore, not only are Luchadores randomly generated at the time of purchase, but the art and associated metadata are stored on the Ethereum blockchain. \n\nThese cute little wrestlers are 24x24 SVG art that can scale to any size. There are millions of possible combinations and only 10,000 of them will ever be minted. \n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/AQph76a.png)\n\nFor the fun of it, I minted two luchadors - *Say hello to El Toro and Javier.*\n\n\n## The Path to Glory\n\nThe roadmap for Luchadores is a little bit different from what we've been seeing as of late. The main roadmap item they are working on is the Lucha Arena. The Lucha Arena will be a turn-based combat game where all game mechanics will be on-chain. Players will be able to choose their fighting style and manage their stable of Luchadores. \n\nAfter the initial 10,000 Luchadores have been minted, the team will introduce a Prodigy System. This system will allow players to generate new luchas to sell or grow their tag teams for the Lucha Arena. \n\nOne roadmap item which is availale now is the ability to choose a unique and permanent name for your Luchador. \n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/8PZZHc3.png)\n\n***Long live El Toro!***\n\n\n## Stats\n* Total Items: 10,000\n* Owners: 642\n* Floor Price: .01 ETH\n* Volume Traded: 1.3 ETH\n\nAt the time of this writing, Luchadores are still avaiable to mint on their [official website](https:\/\/luchadores.io\/). You can also snag some from their store on [Opensea](https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/luchadores-io).\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https:\/\/ourvillage.substack.com\n) and don\u2019t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https:\/\/twitter.com\/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https:\/\/twitter.com\/LumberjackLar).*\n\nWe will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord](https:\/\/MSQ.io\/discord) every Tuesday and Friday at 3PM EST.

        "slug": "get-protocol-is-our-project-of-the-month-september-2021",
        "body": "**MSQ is the new homepage for the decentralized web, and as such, we have plenty of great projects that have already joined us. From Blockchain games and DeFi protocols to NFTs and entire ecosystems, MSQ has it all. Every month we highlight some of the best performing projects and show them some much-deserved love. GET Protocol is a digital Non-Fungible Token (NFT) ticketing platform that has gone from strength to strength over the last few years. We are proud to put them under the spotlight and celebrate their achievement as our Project of the Month!**\n\n## Out With the Old\n\nEvent Management is a massive industry that requires extensive planning and a careful approach to logistics. Traditional ticketing systems give attendees access to a particular venue and sometimes extend premium benefits depending on the grade of ticket they hold. The problem with these systems is that they're often impersonal, inefficient, costly, slow, and don't allow many customizations. In addition, organizers also lose a substantial percentage of their profits to third-party intermediaries.\n\nIn stark contrast, GET Protocol has created a Blockchain-based system that completely reimagines event ticketing.\n\n## The Future of Ticketing\n\nEstablished in 2016, GET Protocol has stuck by its ethos of making Blockchain as hassle-free and easy-to-use as possible. In continuing this vision, they have just launched a new website and content hub, updated DAO-friendly tokenomics, and an exciting new product called *The Digital Twin.*\n\n![](youtube:cjXSeElvbss)\n\n> Check out this informative video explaining GET Protocol\n\n### The Digital Twin\n\n*The Digital Twin* is an extension of GET Protocol\u2019s mission to better serve end-users and clients alike. It allows existing ticketers to greatly benefit from the potential of NFT tickets and Blockchain with none of the difficulties or complexity associated with Blockchain technology.\n\nEvery ticket is integrated with an NFT copy on the Polygon Blockchain, greatly expanding the potential for new and innovative revenue streams and engagement avenues by allowing providers to capture secondary market value and letting attendees collect digital goods.\n\nAccording to GET Protocol, '*The Digital Twin* can be integrated in less than a week and has zero operation risk to existing business operations - meaning existing ticketing companies can give *the Digital Twin* a try to see how NFT tickets can benefit their ticketing and open up new possibilities for their event organizer clients.'\n\n> *The Digital Twin* extends the life cycle of a ticket, packing new utility into each and every one. Gone are the days of tickets being a single-use asset\n\nGET Protocol also announced their launch integrator, [Yourticketprovider.nl](https:\/\/yourticketprovider.nl), a Netherlands-based ticketing issuer well-known for looking beyond the QR code and providing over 2 million tickets a year.\n\n### New Website & Content Hub\n\nGET Protocol launched a brand new website to reflect the scale of their broad infrastructure offered to both existing and new ticketing companies. Their *White-Label* product allows new ticketing companies to get up and running from scratch and existing enterprises to benefit from NFT ticketing.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qdpbCWV.png)\n\nTheir new website also breaks down the complexity of GET Protocol, providing a look at their products and the benefits offered. The content hub showcases industry trends and insights from the global ticketing industry, customer stories, and release information, while their revamped documentation is ideal for developers and those seeking to understand the internal systems that comprise GET Protocol.\n\n### Tokenomics\n\nGET Protocol also updated its tokenomics model to provide scalable ticketing solutions to global audiences by allowing all transactional activity to be on-chain, verifiable, and transparent. *Digital Twin* integrators and *White-Label* only need to top up using the ticketing dashboard to take advantage of GET Protocol's infrastructure. This can even be carried out using traditional fiat payment methods where all the complexity of cryptocurrency is handled in the background.\n\n> 'We believe being able to see value flow through GET Protocol is imperative to the end goal of transitioning to a DAO that is governed by ticketing companies, big and small as well as Blockchain community members who hold GET.'\n\nWe are honored to have GET Protocol as a partner on MSQ and congratulate them as our Project of the Month! The number of contributions they have made to the cryptosphere continues to grow, and we have no doubt that they will succeed in totally transforming the way the ticketing industry operates.",

        "body": "**When we started the process of looking for projects that had an interest in MSQ's vision, we came across the Hive community. To say that the Hive ecosystem is active would be an understatement. They are highly engaged on multiple projects, dapps, and community initiatives. We are proud to have them as a partner on MSQ and want to highlight the immense amount of projects from Hive joining us on MSQ!**\n\n## Collaborating with Hive\n\nHive is a large ecosystem with a wide variety of dapps, projects, and use cases. In order to get a good understanding of how it works, we connected directly with the team at Hive. They have been instrumental in connecting us with a multitude of projects and shaping what would eventually become the Hive Hub.\n\n> [Check out the Hive Hub](\/hubs\/hive)\n\nHive joining us on MSQ is only the first step. As time goes one we hope to see them fully embrace the platform and its features in order to shine a spotlight on everything they are creating.\n\n## Hive Projects You Can Find on MSQ\n\n## Games\n\nWhen it comes to games on Hive, there is an abundance of titles to choose from. Each game has their own vibrant community and innovates on blockchain features in unique ways.\n\n***Splinterlands*** -  a digital, collectible card game built on blockchain technology. It is similar in concept to games like Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone where you build up a collection of cards, which have various stats and abilities to use them to battle other players in skill-based matches.\n\n***Rising Star*** - a card-based RPG where you work your way up from street musician to global megastar. The game has you doing everything on your path to stardom, from completing missions all the way to unlocking permanent fans in the form of collectible NFTs. The most intriguing thing about Rising Star, besides all of the care and thought that went into the game mechanics, is the ability for players to own their in-game assets. NFTs and special cards unlocked during playthroughs can be sold within the in-game marketplace. Blockchain and gaming open the door to a multitude of different possibilities for gamers and Rising Star does a great job highlighting these aspects.\n\n***CryptoBrewMaster*** - lets players set out to collect ingredients, upgrade their brewery, and craft their own beer! The main purpose behind CryptoBrewMaster is to create a game that is not only fun but teaches aspiring craft beer brewers the ins-and-outs of beer production. The game takes a technical approach to brewing in regards to how players need to collect the correct equipment and design a recipe prior to creating their beer. In furtherance of their main purpose, CryptoBrewMaster also partners with different breweries, equipment manufacturers and suppliers in order to connect aspiring brewers with reputable businesses from all around the world!\n\n***Rabona*** - a massive multiplayer online soccer management simulator. Players decide how to build and develop their team, take on the role of the head coach, and manage the financials of their club. Lead your club to the top of the league and become League Champion in a game that embraces all areas of team management.\n\n\n## Health\n\nWhen it comes to your health, making the right choices and creating a positive lifestyle should not seem like a chore. Dapps like Actifit on Hive reward users for their everyday activity and transforms your exercise into a fun and interactive experience.\n\n***Actifit*** - an innovative social dApp that incentivizes a healthy lifestyle by rewarding your everyday activity. The Actifit mobile app tracks user activity and rewards users with AFIT tokens, Actifit innate token, but also HIVE, STEEM, and SPORTS token rewards on supported blockchains and partner communities. Users can sync their activity count using various fitness trackers including Fitbit and Apple Watch.\n\n## Social Media\n\nWhen it comes to social media on Hive, all platforms take a strong stance on providing their users with an open, censorship-resistant space to share their thoughts. In addition, many projects reward content creators with Hive or Hive-based tokens for their content. Take a look at the different platforms and dapps below!\n\n***Dapplr*** - the first design-based app that lets you be a part of the Hive Ecosystem. \u201cDapplr\u201d is derived from the word dapple, meaning spots\/patches of light or color. The design language that the dapplr team has chosen for their application is subtly explained by the name - prioritizing just a few colors and a fun aesthetic to the overall user-experience. The Dapplr team believes that details matter and that can be seen in the colorful liquid-like effects underpinning the enitre application.\n\n***D.Buzz*** - a micro-blogging platform that allows users to create accounts, join in on conversations and post their own content. The team behind D.Buzz was originally on Steem but moved over to the Hive Blockchain during the community hardfork in early 2020. D.Buzz\u2019s mission is to promote freedom of speech and user-rights. By creating a platform that is a decentralized social-media alternative, D.Buzz supports a censorship-resistant platform where users are in control.\n\n***3Speak*** - is a place where content creators directly own their onsite assets and their communities. This platform runs specifically on the Hive blockchain and facilitates a censorship-free environment where content creators can express their views. By using 3Speak, users are rewarded in Hive tokens and can receive donations via the 3Speak token just by using the platform. These tokens act not only as rewards but as governance tokens as well where holders have a voice in the direction of 3Speak.\n\n***Eccency*** - a decentralized open-source social network built and powered by users. Ecency promotes community-building and empowering content creators through rewards on their blogging platform. By being a content creator on Ecency you can earn cryptocurrency, which is rewarded to all users for various social activities they perform on Ecency.com as well as the Ecency Mobile and Desktop applications. Additionally, Ecency\u2019s users can also earn Ecency Points by referring their friends to the platform.\n\n***PeakD*** - a community platform built on Hive that allows users to post their content and exercise true ownership over their content. Decentralization and censorship resistant tech aren\u2019t just buzzwords, censorship resistance and decentralization is baked into blockchains like Hive. Many platforms will say that censorship-resistance and free speech is part of their ideology or company vision. However, when these ideals get tested, companies can be quick to change their policies. On PeakD, decentralization means that users own their content and can use the tools that PeakD has to offer in a manner that they see fit. Touted as Hive\u2019s entry point to the decentralized web, they place a high value on users having true ownership over their content, which can be seen in the way their platform is structured.\n\n***Aureal*** - a decentralized podcast platform built on top of Hive. Aureal acts as a bridge between traditional audio content creators (podcasters) and consumers by connecting them to Web 3.0. The team at Aureal aims to solve the everlasting and painful problem of podcast monetization and discovery without using advertisements. More importantly, the team strives to provide content creators with all the necessary tools they may require.\n\n## Payments\n\nWhen it comes to payments, the Hive ecosystem is constantly coming up with new ways to have merchants and business owners transact on the Hive Blockchain.\n\n***Hive Pay*** - a merchant solution that allows merchants and vendors to easily accept payments in Hive and Hive-engine tokens. With a few simple lines of code, a merchant can add a Hive Pay button to their checkout pages.\n\n## Developer Resources\/Tools\n\nIn order to succeed and innovate within any ecosystem, developer tools and resources are of the uptmost importance. Take a look at some of Hive's development-focused offerings.\n\n***FullAlt*** - a team of passionate developers from the Hive Ecosystem that are creating products for the benefit of Hive and its growing community. One of their most widely used products is HiveTips. HiveTips allows people to tip any user HIVE tokens on various social platforms.\n\n***DLUX*** - an open-source project built on the Hive blockchain that started as a way for users to build, post and monetize virtual reality experiences without needing to know any code themselves. By leveraging networked A-Frame, visitor avatars spawn into social VR rooms with interconnecting portals to other places, all in-browser across mobile, headsets and desktop computers. With full Hive wallet integration, the ability to purchase and tip became a reality for VR art galleries, augmented reality menu systems and 2D web dApps.\n\n## NFTs\nNFTs or Non-fungible tokens have become an increasingly popular usecase for blockchain technology in recent months. They can be used in a wide variety of areas such as art, gaming, real-estate, and more. In addition to the games featured on Hive's ecosystem, let's look at a specific dapp specifically for artists.\n\n***Hive Showroom*** - a digital art marketplace built on the Hive blockchain. NFT Showroom runs on Hive Engine which is a smart contracts side-chain platform for the Hive blockchain. Their on-site currency is SWAP.HIVE which is a token that is pegged 1:1 with Hive. The minting fee to tokenize 1 edition is 5 Hive plus 1 Hive for each extra edition. They charge a 10% market fee for each sale, for secondary sales artists receive a 5% royalty. NFT Showroom aims to provide a platform that is easy to use and less expensive to transact for both the creator and collector and solve existing problems in the crypto art sphere.\n\n## Events\nNetworking and meeting new people is more crucial today than it has ever been. While more and more people are working remotely, the time we can  get together is even more valuable. Let's look at a virtual event put on by our Hive Partner - Splinterlands.\n\n***DYGYCON*** - a new kind of digital conference event built with web 3.0 in mind. Powered by Gamerjibe Social, the gamified expo that hosts DYGYCON will supercharge your networking skills. Your avatar can run, jump, double jump (yes you heard us right), attend presentations, or step up to a private conversation table with a new friend for a quick impromptu meeting. There will be games, giveaways, NFT auctions and more. Best of all, the 3-hour event is completely free to attend. Learn how to enjoy conferences again.\n\n## The Latest Buzz\n\nWhile the list of projects and dapps above is impressive, it is only a fraction of what the Hive Ecosystem has to offer. As MSQ continues to grow, we hope to welcome more Hive projects to our space and provide in-depth content that will benefit the entire blockchain industry.\n\n> Make sure to join MSQ by becoming a part of our growing community on [Discord](https:\/\/discord.gg\/7DaFYQaPat), [YouTube](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCq76OnPaXOnvo73sECoUcBQ?sub_confirmation=1) and [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/HelloMSQ)",

        "body": "***Join us as we bring you another epic Discovery of the Day! There's an entire universe of projects to check out in the wider cryptoverse, and we're doing our best to bring you some of the most promising ones around! If it has a great community, amazing developers and some awesome features, then we want to know about it! Without further ado, today we present: Solana Bananas!***\n\n## A Banana Republic?\n\nDictators, despots, authoritarians, tyrants...call 'em whatever you want, but there have been a bunch of 'em over the years. Those that presided over economies that depended almost exclusively on the exportation of agricultural goods, particularly coffee or bananas, were the undisputed leaders of what became known as *Banana Republics.* Yes, trouble in paradise, [Far Cry](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Far_Cry_(video_game)) 1 without the trigens, tropical travesties\u2014you get the idea.\n\nWhat does this have to do with our Discovery of the Day? Everything and nothing of course. [Solana Bananas](https:\/\/solanabananas.com\/) is an NFT collection of 1,500 flavorsome fruits hanging in the plantations of the [Solana](https:\/\/solana.com\/) Blockchain. Each of these entirely unique bananas is algorithmically generated and stored with proof of ownership on Solana's fast, efficient and secure Blockchain. As an added bonus, when a user mints a Solana Banana, they will have the chance to mint an ultra rare Banana like the treasured *Golden Banana*, or a *Zombie Banana*.\n\nEvery Banana is made up from over 130 different attributes including background color, facial expression, hairstyle, eyewear, skin color, apparel, clothing and so on. Certain attributes are rarer than others, but regardless of what a user receives, there will only ever be 1,500 Solana Bananas.\n\nSolana Bananas wants to give back to the world, which is exactly why 10% of all proceeds will go directly towards the [Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund](https:\/\/gorillafund.org\/). As an organization that protects critically endangered mountain gorillas through research, training, community outreach, and constant on-the-ground presence in Rwanda, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund needs sufficient support to ensure their work is carried out unimpeded. Solana Bananas believe this cause to be very much aligned with their values and the theme behind their lively NFT project.\n\nAnd now let's take a look at some of these brilliant Bananas up-close:\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Ob8Nd3x.png)\n\n> Snake Banana Skin is here to chew gum and retain his ripeness...and he's all outta ripeness\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/XhnHpuq.png)\n\n> Hours in the Miami sun left Bert Banana feeling uncharacteristically red\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jTv6C4D.png)\n\n> Bullish Blue Banana brazenly binges barbital brands\n\n## Ba Na Na Naaaaa...Ba Na Na Naaaaa (It's Beethoven)\n\nForgive the onomatopoeia, it's nearly impossible for me to write such a Potassium-rich post like this without making a pun or two. So the Solana Bananas Roadmap (which you can also view in their [Discord](https:\/\/discord.gg\/hMQPFTZ2)) is detailed below for your convenience. Q3 of 2021 has come and gone, but it seems like there's a fair amount planned for the coming months and all the way into the second quarter of 2022. Very nice stuff. Anyway, see for yourself:\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/kK9nHPP.png)\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sDl3AAV.png)\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that, unlike many other projects that feature several thousand generative NFTs, Solana Bananas is limited to a mere 1,500. This means fewer owners, greater rarity and, if all goes according to plan, higher value as the months and years roll by. From what I can tell, the project is moving along at a healthy pace and has a suitably strong community behind it.\n\n## Stats\n\nSolana Bananas is currently sold out, so if you want to pick one up, you'll need to head over to their [Solanart page](https:\/\/solanart.io\/collections\/solanabananas) and buy one there. Now how about some stats?\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\n\n- **Total Items** - 264\/1,500\n- **Total Owners** - 196\n\nWell, what can I tell you? Solana Bananas is a delightfully quirky NFT project with some fun features and a unique approach within the ever-expanding world of Non-Fungible Tokens. Be sure to check out their [website](https:\/\/solanabananas.com\/), follow them on [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/SolanaBananas) and join their [Discord](https:\/\/discord.gg\/hMQPFTZ2) for all the latest news from the bunch (I can't help myself, OK?)

        "name": "El Salvador's Love Affair with Bitcoin",
        "slug": "el-salvadors-love-affair-with-bitcoin",
        "body": "***El Salvador is the first country in the world to make Bitcoin legal. Will this be the answer to the nation's financial woes? Or will it be a match made in hell? Let's find out more!***\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/NuAfM27.png)\n\n## The Beginnings of a Financial Romance\n\nUnless you've been living under a rock for the last while, you must have heard that El Salvador recently passed a bill to make [Bitcoin](https:\/\/bitcoin.org\/en\/) legal tender. In fact, the bill was passed by a large majority, gaining [62 out of 84 possible votes](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/americas\/el-salvador-approves-first-law-bitcoin-legal-tender-2021-06-09\/\/) within Congress. Under the new law, which will be implemented in September 2021, Bitcoin must be accepted by firms when offered as payment for goods and services. Tax contributions can also be paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, El Salvador is not getting rid of the US Dollar all together. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele stated:\n\n> *'The use of Bitcoin will be optional, nobody will receive Bitcoin if they don't want it. If someone receives a payment in Bitcoin, they can choose to automatically receive it in Dollars'*\n\nEl Salvador is the first country in the world to make Bitcoin legit. You might be wondering why this is such a big deal for El Salvador as well as several other Central and Latin American countries. Let me explain by first giving you some history on the nation that is El Salvador.\n\nThis small Central American country's past is a troubled one. It has endured political and economic instability with a series of coups, revolts, and a succession of authoritarian rulers. Persistent socioeconomic inequality and civil unrest led to the [Salvadoran Civil War](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Salvadoran_Civil_War) which took place between 1979 and 1992. Due to this constant state of conflict, El Salvador has been ravaged by poverty and gang-related criminality.\n\nTraditionally, El Salvador relied heavily on coffee exports for revenue. However, they later looked to diversify their international exports and the economy by opening up trade and financial links as well as expanding their manufacturing sector. To facilitate trade and attract foreign investment, El Salvador dropped its own currency, the Colon, in 2001 and adopted the US Dollar.\n\nSo what has all of this got to do with Bitcoin? Well, simply put, adopting the US Dollar didn't solve El Salvador's financial problems. The foreign trade that was promised, the high-quality jobs, the foreign investment, the increase in exports...all of this didn't come to pass. So how does El Salvador keep its financial head above water?\n\nForeign remittances is the answer. In 2019, foreign remittances amounted to [$5.65 billion](https:\/\/ticotimes.net\/2021\/01\/04\/el-salvador-marks-20-years-of-dollarization-with-weak-economic-impulse\/), equivalent to 16% of the country's GDP. Many Salvadorans migrate to the United States to find work so they can send money home to their families, and foreign remittances allow them to accomplish this.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/CxK2PN7.jpg)\n\nNaturally, this is where Bitcoin comes in. Now as many of you know, sending money through the traditional banking system is slow and expensive, because everyone wants a slice of the pie. Moreover, opening a bank account requires legal documents, like a passport. This is a major issue in developing countries where accessing official documents is typically expensive, time-consuming and complicated.\n\nBank accounts...now that's another problem! According to President Bukele: \n\n> *'Some 70% of people in El Salvador lack access to traditional financial services.'*\n\nSo, with such a large percentage of the population unbanked, Bitcoin could solve a lot of problems by getting money from abroad, quickly and far more affordably.\n\n## Not Quite a Fairytale?\n\nMany arguments have been put forward criticizing El Salvador's decision to make Bitcoin legal tender. The [IMF](https:\/\/www.imf.org\/en\/Home) and [World Bank](https:\/\/www.worldbank.org\/en\/home) have outright refused to assist with the roll-out. The World Bank cited that they had problems with the [transparency](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-57507386\/) of Bitcoin transactions and the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining.\n\nExcuse me? Did they not hear President Bukele say that El Savador will mine Bitcoin using geothermal power from the country's volcanoes?\n\n> More on that in a follow-up article. Stay tuned!\n\nOne common argument is that using Bitcoin is too difficult and risky for the average person. To address this issue, President Bukele has committed to offering training to people and initiatives promoting the use of Bitcoin.\n\nHe is also launching an e-wallet called Chivo, which is Salvadoran slang for 'cool.' As part of the package, people who make use of it will receive $30 in Bitcoin so that adoption is incentivized.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/PgSkFU1.png)\n\n[Athena Bitcoin](https:\/\/www.athenabitcoin.com\/) announced plans to install 1,500 Bitcoin ATMs in El Salvador, targeting places where residents receive remittances from abroad. This should make it easier for people to buy and sell Bitcoin.\n\nPresident Bukele was asked whether the use of Bitcoin would encourage criminal activity and money laundering. This is a common argument often used by opponents of crypto and Blockchain. He replied that criminals are already using the Dollar...\n\n> *'The problem is not the Dollar, it is the criminals.'*\n\nAnother argument is that Bitcoin is highly volatile, which makes it risky. However, with rampant inflation across many Central and Latin American countries, the volatility of Bitcoin doesn't hold a candle to the levels of inflation these nations have endured. For example, Argentina is battling an unsustainable debt load while Venezuela\u2019s economy has shrunk by 75% since 2013. Nice job fiat currencies!\n\nDissenters have often said that Bitcoin transactions are slow and expensive. Slow? I'm not so sure about that. I've personally had to wait longer than 10 days for money to arrive in my bank account from abroad. In my opinion, Bitcoin is definitely the hare while banks are more like the old arthritic tortoise...\n\nAlso, don't forget Jack Mallers' [Strike app](https:\/\/strike.me\/) and the [Lightning Network](https:\/\/lightning.network\/). The Strike app makes it fast and cheap to send and receive small amounts of Bitcoin. This is because Strike is powered by the Lightning Network, a layer 2 protocol that settles transactions 'off-chain' through a growing network of user-hosted channels and nodes. In fact, the Strike app has quickly become the most popular one in El Salvador.\n\n![](twitter:DocumentingBTC\/status\/1394393371431538695)\n\nExpensive? Start looking at organizations like [Western Union](https:\/\/www.westernunion.com\/) and [MoneyGram](https:\/\/www.westernunion.com\/)...the fee system is mind-boggling! Fees differ depending on where you're sending your money, whether you're using a bank transfer or a credit card, or even whether your recipient is receiving the money as cash or into a bank account. Also, one time a relative sent me some money via Western Union, I had to show my passport to prove my identity. So as it stands, the use of personal documentation is necessary to transact in the legacy financial system.\n\n## Making It Together\n\nWhether other Central and Latin American countries follow El Salvador's lead and make Bitcoin legal tender remains to be seen. The reaction of the IMF and The World Bank is certainly something to take into account. Do they really believe Bitcoin is too risky and simply don't want to be associated with it? Or do they see Bitcoin as a threat to the financial status quo and therefore their power and influence? Hmmm...\n\nIn my opinion, anything that shakes up the traditional financial system is only a good thing. Whatver happens, you can be sure that I'll be bringing you all the latest updates on El Salvador and Bitcoin as they occur.

From Monday to Friday we bring you our Discovery of the Day, a series of special articles featuring some of our top picks from across the cryptosphere. Be it DeFi, NFTs, Blockchain games or otherwise, we cover all the important stuff you need to know! Today we bring you a project that promises one new NFT every single day...forever!? How can that be? Let's find out! This is...Nouns!**_\n\n## A Naming Word\n\nI don't know if you guys are aware (I'm not sure how you'd know this), but I'm actually qualified to teach and lecture English. Yup, whether it's the poetic works of Romantics like [Percy Bysshe Shelley](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley) (who wrote my favorite poem, [Ozymandias](https:\/\/www.poetryfoundation.org\/poems\/46565\/ozymandias) and was married to [Mary Shelley](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mary_Shelley), author of [Frankenstein](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frankenstein)) or the dour narratives of authors like [Aldous Huxley](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Aldous_Huxley), I can tell you all about that...but not today.\n\nNaturally, that's more the literary side of English. Then there's the language aspect to consider. Now something you may or may not know is the **9 Parts of Speech**. They are:\n\n> 1. Articles - **a\/an** *(indefinite)* and the *(definite)*\n> 2. Interjections - **Wow!**, **Oh!**, **Woah!**, **Yikes!** and so on\n> 3. Prepositions - **at**, **in**, **upon**, **beneath**, **within**, **outside**, **on top** and so on\n> 4. Conjunctions - **so**, **because**, **then**, **yet**, **but**, **and**, **or** and so on\n> 5. Adverbs - **longingly**, **quickly**, **eagerly**, **lazily** and so on\n> 6. Verbs - **dodge**, **dip**, **duck**, **dive**, and...[**dodge**](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=18ASBsQfXnw)\n> 7. Adjectives - **coarse**, **strong**, **red**, **terrific** and so on\n> 8. Pronouns - **he**, **they**, **she**, **him**, **it**, **them** and so on\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ehltRi2.gif)\n\n> Patches O'Houlihan knows his stuff!\n\nSo what's the last Part of Speech you ask? Why, it's the big kahuna of the English language (and maybe every language for that matter). The subject, the object, the idea, the place...\n\n## Nouns\n\nThere are many, many nouns in the English language, but something tells me that in the not-too-distant future, [Nouns](https:\/\/nouns.wtf\/), 'an experimental attempt to improve the formation of on-chain avatar communities,' may one day dwarf this number if what they say is indeed factual. In many respects, Nouns builds on the model established by legendary NFT project [Cryptopunks](https:\/\/www.larvalabs.com\/cryptopunks) in that it attempts to bootstrap identity, community, governance and a treasury that can be accessed and used by the community itself.\n\nSo how does it all work? Well, here's a rundown of the mechanics that underpin Nouns:\n\n- All Nouns artwork is in the public domain\n- One (1) Noun is trustlessly auctioned forever on an indefinite basis\n- 100% of the proceeds from Nouns auctions are trustlessly sent to the Nouns DAO treasury\n- Once an auction has been settled, the next begins immediately\n- Every single Noun is a member of Nouns DAO\n- The Nouns DAO uses a fork of [Compound Governance](https:\/\/compound.finance\/governance)\n- 1 Noun = 1 Vote\n- The treasury is controlled exclusively by Nouns via governance\n- The artwork is generative and stored directly on-chain rather than [IPFS](https:\/\/ipfs.io\/)\n- There are *no explicit rules* for attribute scarcity, all Nouns are equally rare\n- 'Nounders' receive rewards in the form of Nouns (10% of supply for the first 5 years)\n\nWith regards to the creation of Nouns, they are generated randomly based on [Ethereum](https:\/\/ethereum.org\/) block hashes. No 'if' statements or any other rules serve to govern Noun scarcity, meaning that all Nouns are equally rare. At time of writing, Nouns are generated from 2 different backgrounds, 30 different body types, 137 accessories, 234 distinct heads, and 21 different kinds of glasses.\n\n> If you would like to experiment with off-chain Noun generation, you may do so via the [Nouns Playground](https:\/\/nouns.wtf\/playground)\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/aggg7cG.png)\n\n### Nouns DAO\n\nThe Nouns DAO makes of a fork of Compound Governance and functions as the main means by which governance occurs within the Nouns ecosystem. As aforementioned, 100% of all ETH proceeds from daily Noun auctions go directly towards the Nouns DAO treasury. Each and every Noun is a permanent member of Nouns DAO and is therefore entitled to one vote in all matters concerning governance. Noun votes cannot be transferred, meaning that if a Noun is sold, the vote goes long with it. However, they can be delegated, meaning that your vote can be assigned to someone else as long as you retain ownership of your Noun.\n\nOf course you must be wondering what a Noun looks like up close (unless you've seen one before of course). Fear not, here's a few Nouns I generated using the Noun Playground:\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/iD8KHw4.png)\n\n> This colorful trashcan is inclusive and open-minded...\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Y8RXASC.png)\n\n> Strawberry, meet Moon. Oh, and don't forget your life jacket!\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/RlFZ7vD.png)\n\n> 0_0\n\n## On-Chain Artwork\n\nAll Nouns are stored directly on the Ethereum Blockchain and do not make use of pointers to other networks such as IPFS. The reason for this is because Noun parts are compressed and stored on-chain through the use of a custom run-length encoding (RLE) which is a kind of lossless compression.\n\nThe compressed parts are efficiently converted into a single base64 encoded SVG image on-chain. To achieve this, each individual part is decoded into an intermediate format before being converted into a series of SVG rects using batched, on-chain string concatenation. Upon generating the entire SVG, it is subsequently base64 encoded.\n\nIf you didn't really understand that, don't worry...all you need to know is that Nouns are all unique and stored directly on Ethereum.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/pWV3yV4.gif)\n\n## Nounder's Reward\n\n'Nounders' consists of the ten builders that brought Nouns to life. Herewith their Twitter tags:\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/0HSfzTI.png)\n\nSince all the funds received from Noun auctions go towards the Nouns DAO, the Nounders decided to compensate themselves with Nouns. Every tenth Noun for the first five years of the project (Nouns designated #0, #10, #20, #30 and so on) will be automatically sent to the Nounder's multisig so that they may be vested and shared among the founding members of the project.\n\n> An important note: Nounder distributions don't interfere with the cadence of 24 hour auctions. Again, Nouns are sent directly to the Nounder's multisig, and auctions continue according to schedule with the next available Noun ID.\n\n## SharkDAO\n\n[SharkDAO](https:\/\/sharkdao.community\/) actually started out as a group of strangers from the internet that wanted to pool their resources together and acquire Nouns.

        "body": "***Greetings MSQ friends! How's it going? You know what time it is...that's right, it's another killer Discovery of the Day! MSQ just moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can sign up for a profile and start exploring all the site has to offer right now! From Monday to Friday we bring you some of the best projects from across the cryptosphere. Whether it's NFTs, DeFi or Blockchain games, you'll find it all right here! Today we bring you a project featuring NFTs that respond to your actions! It's...the dudes!***\n\n## thedude\n\nThe world of NFTs has been nothing short of a godsend for countless talented artists, allowing them to pursue their lifelong dreams and showcase their artistic abilities to audiences across the world...\n\nBut what about all the exceptionally talented programmers?\n\nWell, today we're excited to share a story about an incredibly gifted programmer who goes by the name of [thedude](https:\/\/twitter.com\/thedudesnft) with you. Now this person is responsible for creating completely code generated NFT profile picture collections with ***'No designer, just code.'*** Wild, right?\n\nThus far, thedude has created several PFP collections using his creative approach: [the dudes](https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/thedudes), [the duds](https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/theduds), [the abstract dudes](https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/the-abstract-dudes) and [the dudes factory](https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/the-dudes-factory).\n\nAll of this has been created by one person (yup, thedude) who has been coding interactive web apps since he was 15! So it seems he's always had a knack for this stuff, and it's very clear that he's...one busy dude!\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/nE2JWoK.gif)\n\n> When in doubt...just play it cool\n\n### the dudes, the duds & the abstract duds\n\n[the dudes](https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/thedudes) is the first interactive fully code generated NFT collection to appear on the [Ethereum](https:\/\/ethereum.org\/) Blockchain. In essence, the dudes is the genesis collection of the overall project. And don't forget\u2014no designer worked on this...it's nothing more than a few lines of code that generates random ugly dudes (they're not ugly actually, they're kinda sweet and endearing!)\n\nAll traits are assigned inside the smart contract itself while each rarity score is defined on the chain. There are a total of 21,600 unique dudes, but only 512 will ever be made available to claim. That...isn't a whole lot. If anything, that means the dudes are extremely rare, so owning one really is something special!\n\nWhen I first saw these guys, I couldn't believe they were the random product of some algorithm! It's quite bizarre to say the least, and of course, very impressive as well! Feast your eyes on some of these 'ugly' dudes below *(also, can we have a word count for how many times I've mentioned the word 'dude' in this article!?)*\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fU3HRbk.png)\n\n> the dudes\n\nNext up we have ['the duds.'](https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/theduds) Now these guys were airdropped by the creator of 'the dudes.' The intriguing part about this collection is that they slowly reveal themselves as time passes. After 07\/28\/2022, they will show their faces fully. Take a look at their current state below \ud83d\udc40\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GfFxqYv.png)\n\n> the duds\n\nAnd finally we have ['the abstract dudes'](https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/the-abstract-dudes) which are derivatives of the original ['the dudes'](https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/thedudes) and well...it's in the name! They look super abstract! The original 'the dudes' smart contract was used to create these pieces. This collection served as the proof of concept that revealed the potential possibilities of harnessing the dudes' DNA.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/6tEIDCm.png)\n\n> the abstract dudes\n\nOne aspect that makes this project truly special is that every single NFT is interactive. If you visit the dudes' [OpenSea](https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/thedudes) page, you can click on any dude to 'agitate' it, or you can move your mouse around and watch its gaze follow your cursor. Now that's some really funky stuff!\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/TWrelYb.gif)\n\n### the pixels\n\nNow let's move on to thedude's latest endeavor: the pixels. This collection consists of 5,120 'the pixels' that live on the [Ethereum](https:\/\/ethereum.org\/en\/) Blockchain. A unique element of the pixels is that they constantly change and evolve\u2014this is possible because the traits are embedded into the smart contract, allowing it to delegate other contracts to manipulate each pixel.\n\nThe contract has a feature enabled called 'the pixel inc,' granting the NFTs the ability to adopt different traits for special occasions such as Halloween and Christmas. I swear, each project made by thedude just gets cooler and cooler! Kudos for the totally genius innovation...whoever you are!\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/kw1vnVD.gif)\n\n> the pixels\n\n### the dudes DAO\n\nWe've established that the dudes are awesome, but do you want to know something that's even *more* awesome? Everyone who owns one of these NFTs from any one of these collections is part of something bigger: **'our dudes DAO.'**\n\n100% of all existing royalties are owned by the DAO. Its primary role is a simple one\u2014to encourage the growth of the dudes brand and project as a whole.\n\n> A decentralized autonomous organization is an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government.\n\n## the dudes roadmap\n\nthe dudes project is actually split into two separate roadmaps: the Dude development roadmap, and the Community development roadmap.\n\nThe Dude roadmap focuses on airdrops, collaborations with other projects, staking and more. You can view the collaborations that the dudes have engaged in so far via [the dudes factory](https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/the-dudes-factory)\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/QRnekpt.png)\n\n> 'Our dude development roadmap is centered around delivering project value to our holders...'\n\nNow the Community roadmap is a little different\u2014simply put, the DAO votes on suggestions provided by the community via the shared Trello board, which can be viewed [here](https:\/\/trello.com\/invite\/b\/SilI1mJf\/3017d49963aeb65364dd8a81d42442d2\/dude-owners-community-board)\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/oh9bSY6.png)\n\n## the dudes statistics\n\nUnfortunately all of the collections we have showcased today are sold out \ud83d\ude2d But not to worry! You can still grab yourself one of these unique interactive NFTs on the dudes' various OpenSea pages:\n\n* [the dudes](https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/thedudes)\n* [the duds](https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/theduds)\n* [the abstract dudes](https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/the-abstract-dudes)\n* [the pixels](https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/the-pixels-inc)\n\nI don't know about you, but the innovation within this project and the pure creative genius thedude possesses is seriously phenomenal! I'm intrigued to learn more and see what thedude ends up creating in the future! I highly recommend you follow the dudes over on [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/thedudesnft) and join their [Discord](https:\/\/discord.gg\/wM7HSMDV4B) so that you can keep up to date with all the latest details and collections being released by thedude!\n\nAnd that brings us to the conclusion of yet another seriously wicked MSQ Discovery of the Day!

        "slug": "the-role-of-crypto-in-nigeria",
        "body": "***If you look up Bitcoin on [Google Trends](https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/explore?q=bitcoin\/), you will see that Nigeria is usually ranked the number one country by search interest. But why is this happening if the Nigerian government recently announced a crackdown on Crypto?***\n\n## Nigeria's Crises\n\nNigeria is a country plagued by social unrest and rampant inflation.\n\nIn October 2020, the most populous African nation saw massive [public demonstrations](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-africa-54678345\/) against police brutality. After authorities tore into protesters with tear gas and water cannons, 69 people were killed and many more horribly injured.\n\nThe Nigerian government reacted by freezing the bank accounts of organizations that were helping protesters. They also froze the accounts of people speaking out against government policies.\n\nThe majority of goods purchased in Nigeria are imported. In 2019, Nigeria's [imported goods](https:\/\/oec.world\/en\/profile\/country\/nga\/) accounted for $52.5 billion, making it the 50th largest trade destination in the world.\n\nThe Nigerian currency is the Naira, which is highly volatile. Throughout 2021, the inflation rate has hovered around 18%. To hedge against this, Nigerians prefer to pay for their imported goods with US Dollars. However, US Dollars are hard to come by.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/EzZLZyt.jpg)\n\n> Money printer go brrrr!\n\n## Crypto to the Rescue!\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin trading platform [Paxful](https:\/\/paxful.com\/), Nigeria is now second only to the US for Bitcoin trading. The Dollar volume of crypto received by users in Nigeria in May 2021 was $2.4 billion, up from $684 million in December 2020.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/pIBNZYF.png)\n\nDespite talks of regulating and banning cryptocurrencies in Nigeria, the market keeps going from strength to strength. Distrustful of banks that can freeze your account, Nigerians are using cryptocurrencies to feed their families, run their businesses and educate their children.\n\nThe young and educated population along with increased internet adoption has helped to facilitate the exponential adoption of Bitcoin. The borderless nature of Bitcoin makes it a viable option for making both local and international payments. [Cryptofully.com](https:\/\/www.cryptofully.com\/) is a great example in this case. Cryptofully allows people to send money to Nigeria using Peer-2-Peer (P2P) networking. The crypto is then converted into Naira. Using the Cryptofully app, users can send and receive crypto, pay bills and earn rewards.\n\nNigerians are also taking advantage of the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Industry and using DeFi loans to run their businesses. Being unbanked is no longer a barrier to raising capital and running a business in Nigeria.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/h98e5nX.jpg)\n\n[Xend Finance](https:\/\/xend.finance\/) is a Nigerian DeFi start-up that enables credit unions to access DeFi for their members by using decentralized stablecoins such as DAI and BUSD. Members can take out loans and earn interest on their savings. In a country that has seen 3 massive currency devaluations over the last 3 years, projects such as Xend Finance offer hope and a way out of poverty for many Nigerians. \n\n> *'We target non-crypto users, financially underserved users and users in unstable economies that need their assets to be protected by any means necessary. We are the answers to their prayers'* - Ugochukwu Aronu, CEO and founder of Xend Finance\n\n## Foreign 'Intervention' (The Good Kind)\n\nOne cryptocurrency that has set its sights firmly on the African market is [Electroneum](https:\/\/electroneum.com\/), a mobile-based digital payments platform powered by Blockchain. It enables people to send transactions anywhere in the world quickly and affordably. Users can also top-up their mobile phones and pay utility bills using the native coin, ETN. The Nigerian market is a perfect fit for Electroneum. Users are generally young mobile phone users who are keen to adopt new technologies.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/BUh6oud.png)\n\nThe Nigerian government has announced plans to release its own digital currency later in 2021. However, it remains to be seen if this is embraced as enthusiastically as independent cryptocurrencies.",
