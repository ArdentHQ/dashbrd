      "body": "***Welcome to Around the Square! These articles highlight industry trends, projects on MSQ, and general news as it relates to the blockchain industry. Today, we are taking a look at the variety of NFT projects joining us on MSQ. Let's dive in!***\n\n## What Are NFTs?\n\nFor the uninitiated, NFTs stand for Non-fungible tokens. Fungible meaning that every item is replaceable and interchangable with a similar item---think dollar bills for example. Non-fungible is the inverse of that definition meaning that every non-fungible item is unique and one of a kind.\n\nYou can get a quck breakdown of NFTs and how they work by checking out this short video:\n\n![What Is an NFT?](youtube:BBy8aKtiaqo)\n\nIf you have been paying attention to the recent popularity of NFTs, you can understand that this field is still developing and has a lot of room for innovation and growth. NFTs will continue to evolve and be used across a variety of sectors, which is why we are excited to showcase some of the best projects working on NFTs on MSQ. Let's explore some of the areas where NFTs are making strides.\n\n## NFTs & Games\n\nOn MSQ we have a wide variety of projects that are taking advantage of NFTs and introducing them as a core mechanic in their gameplay. See below for a list of games and developers coming to MSQ:\n\n* [Splinterlands](https://MSQ.io/projects/splinterlands) - a digital, collectible card game built on blockchain technology. It is similar in concept to games like Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone where you build up a collection of cards, which have various stats and abilities to use them to battle other players in skill-based matches.\n\n* [Gala Games](https://MSQ.io/projects/gala-games) - A powerhouse development studio working on Town Star and their upcoming MMORPG, Mirandus!\n* Axie Infinity - a digital pet universe where players battle, raise and trade fantasy creatures called Axies\n* Rising Star - a card-based RPG where you work your way up from street musician to global megastar.\n* [CryptoBrewMaster](https://MSQ.io/projects/cryptobrewmaster) - set out to collect ingredients, upgrade your brewery, and craft your own beer!\n* Rabona - a massive multiplayer online soccer management simulator.\n\n## NFTs & Art\n\nAt the height of the NFT art craze this past summer, Beeple sold an artwork for 69 million dollars. While one can make the argument that NFTs are becoming over saturated we believe that there is a lot of space for the industry to grow and mature.\n\nOn the art front, MSQ is happy to have NFT Showroom joining us. NFT Showroom runs on Hive Engine which is a smart contracts side-chain platform for the Hive blockchain. Their on-site currency is SWAP.HIVE which is a token that is pegged 1:1 with Hive. The minting fee to tokenize 1 edition is 5 Hive plus 1 Hive for each extra edition. They charge a 10% market fee for each sale, for secondary sales artists receive a 5% royalty. NFT Showroom aims to provide a platform that is easy to use and less expensive to transact for both the creator and collector and solve existing problems in the crypto art sphere.\n\n## NFTs & Authenticated Goods\n\nLast but not least we are always looking to highlight projects which incorporate NFTs in unique ways. This brings us to our partner--D¢ENT!\n\nD¢ENT aims to be the preeminent lifestyle brand for the crypto-empowered. Their brand is focused on creating NFT Authenticated Apparel and fine goods. Their merchandise and brand were created as a response to the lack of quality crypto-lifestyle goods while pioneering new and innovative “phygital” (phyiscal+digital) experiences. Each item in their online shop gives users the option to add NFT tokenization to their products. Every item from their UnLtd. Collection, for example, is able to be paired with an UnLtd. NFT, proving it’s authenticity on the Ethereum Blockchain.\n\n## Working on NFTs?\n\nAre you currently working on a project involving NFTs? Reach out to us and tell us about it! We would love to have you on MSQ!\n\n> Make sure to join MSQ by becoming a part of our growing community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/7DaFYQaPat), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq76OnPaXOnvo73sECoUcBQ?sub_confirmation=1) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HelloMSQ)",

Today, we are taking a look at 8 Amazing Games Coming to MSQ. Let's dive in!***\n\n## Blockchain and Gaming\n\nBlockchain technology has a wide variety of use cases that impact the way we take ownership and possession of our digital purchases. Blockchain technology will not only impact ownership over our digital items but it will also revamp game economies and provide numerous opportunities for developers. We at MSQ feel that gaming is so important that we have even etched out a place on our homepage specifically for games! Let's run through some of the most innovative games and development studios coming to MSQ!\n\n## Splinterlands\n\nSplinterlands is a digital, collectible card game built on blockchain technology. It is similar in concept to games like Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone where you build up a collection of cards, which have various stats and abilities to use them to battle other players in skill-based matches.\n\n![Learn about Splinterlands!](youtube:PkyOBguaogY)\n\n## Gala Games (Town Star & Mirandus)\n\nGala Games is a powerhouse development studio working on Town Star and their upcoming MMORPG, Mirandus! own Star, is a deceptively simple-looking but incredibly deep farming simulation in which a user builds a farm to compete in weekly competitions. At various places, NFTs can be used in the game to provide bonuses but are not required to play, have fun, or compete.\n\nMirandus, the MMORPG/Adventure Simulator currently under development by Gala Games is working to completely redefine both the game development pipeline, as well as the gameplay model by putting the power in the hands of the players and giving them ultimate control over the in-game economy.\n\n![Learn about Gala Games!](youtube:5jRLf0mfba8)\n\n\n\n## Axie Infinity\nAxie Infinity is a digital pet universe where players battle, raise and trade fantasy creatures called Axies. To play the game players start by purchasing three Axies on the Axie Marketplace. The game is currently in alpha phase, but in the future players will be able to start playing without having to purchase Axies. Instead, they will receive non-transferable Axies that have a capped earning potential. After a player has acquired their Axies they can play the PVE adventure mode, battle with their teams in PVP or breed their Axies. All Axies that are earned through breeding can then be used to battle, trade or be put up for sale on the Axie Marketplace.\n\n![Learn about Axie Infinity!](youtube:4kPRnA929x0)\n\n## Rising Star\nRising Star is a card-based RPG where you work your way up from street musician to global megastar. The game has you doing everything on your path to stardom, from completing missions all the way to unlocking permanent fans in the form of collectible NFTs. The most intriguing thing about Rising Star, besides all of the care and thought that went into the game mechanics, is the ability for players to own their in-game assets. NFTs and special cards unlocked during playthroughs can be sold within the in-game marketplace. Blockchain and gaming open the door to a multitude of different possibilities for gamers and Rising Star does a great job highlighting these aspects.\n\n![Learn about Rising Star!](youtube:DFVuGGKcKcI)\n\n## CryptoBrewMaster\nCryptoBrewMaster lets players set out to collect ingredients, upgrade their brewery, and craft their own beer! The main purpose behind CryptoBrewMaster is to create a game that is not only fun but teaches aspiring craft beer brewers the ins-and-outs of beer production. The game takes a technical approach to brewing in regards to how players need to collect the correct equipment and design a recipe prior to creating their beer. In furtherance of their main purpose, CryptoBrewMaster also partners with different breweries, equipment manufacturers and suppliers in order to connect aspiring brewers with reputable businesses from all around the world!\n\n![Learn about CryptoBrewMaster!](youtube:GoYz591nDoU)\n\n## Rabona\nRabona is a massive multiplayer online soccer management simulator. Players decide how to build and develop their team, take on the role of the head coach, and manage the financials of their club. Lead your club to the top of the league and become League Champion in a game that embraces all areas of team management.\n\n![Learn about CryptoBrewMaster!](youtube:zlFhwBPyVq8)\n\n\n## EGAMERS\n\nEGAMERS deserves an honorable mention on our list since they have extensive and in-depth coverage on all things gaming in the blockchain space. Their site covers a wide variety of topics. Things that you might stumble across include:\n\n* Interviews with Game Developers\n* Reviews of the latest blockchain games\n* How-to videos and how to get started in the latest games\n* Editorials\n* And more!\n\n![Learn about EGAMERS!](youtube:_hXIUHmqJ_g)\n\n## Working on a Game?\n\nAre you currently developing a game that utilized blockchain technology?

We hope that the Hive Hub on MSQ will be an invaluable resource for the Hive community and be an entry point for new users looking to learn more about Hive.\n\nThe Hive Hub will include projects, dapps, videos, and news from all around the Hive Ecosystem. As we work clsoely with Hive partners, we will look to onboard new projects and create a Hub that completely encapsulates the vision of the Hive ecosystem.\n\n## The Hive Hub Video Series\n\nOne of the largest initiatives at MSQ is content production. Since announcing MSQ, the content production team has created over 100 videos focused on short explainers on projects, defining blockchain terms, producing special content such as our \"Blockchains of\" series.\n\nFor Hubs, we want to do more. We want to create content focused on specific ecosystems like Hive that will serve as tutorials for new members and simplify complex concepts and processes. As we continue to add more videos to the Hive Hub, we would love to receive community feedback and suggestions for new content. Our goal is to make blockchain simple and easy to understand. It is a theme that permeates across all of our videos and we hope to continue that process within the Hive Hub.\n\n> Check out our overview of the newly released [Hive Video Series](/projects/MSQ/blog/hive-video-series-now-available-on-hive-hub) for the Hive Hub\n\n## Discovering Projects within the Hive Hub\n\nOne of the strongest benefits regarding the Hive Hub is being able to get a bird's-eye-view of the projects, news, and videos pertaining to the Hive Ecosystem.

To say that the Hive ecosystem is active would be an understatement. They are highly engaged on multiple projects, dapps, and community initiatives. We are proud to have them as a partner on MSQ and want to highlight the immense amount of projects from Hive joining us on MSQ!**\n\n## Collaborating with Hive\n\nHive is a large ecosystem with a wide variety of dapps, projects, and use cases. In order to get a good understanding of how it works, we connected directly with the team at Hive. They have been instrumental in connecting us with a multitude of projects and shaping what would eventually become the Hive Hub.\n\n> [Check out the Hive Hub](/hubs/hive)\n\nHive joining us on MSQ is only the first step. As time goes one we hope to see them fully embrace the platform and its features in order to shine a spotlight on everything they are creating.\n\n## Hive Projects You Can Find on MSQ\n\n## Games\n\nWhen it comes to games on Hive, there is an abundance of titles to choose from. Each game has their own vibrant community and innovates on blockchain features in unique ways.\n\n***Splinterlands*** -  a digital, collectible card game built on blockchain technology. It is similar in concept to games like Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone where you build up a collection of cards, which have various stats and abilities to use them to battle other players in skill-based matches.\n\n***Rising Star*** - a card-based RPG where you work your way up from street musician to global megastar. The game has you doing everything on your path to stardom, from completing missions all the way to unlocking permanent fans in the form of collectible NFTs. The most intriguing thing about Rising Star, besides all of the care and thought that went into the game mechanics, is the ability for players to own their in-game assets. NFTs and special cards unlocked during playthroughs can be sold within the in-game marketplace. Blockchain and gaming open the door to a multitude of different possibilities for gamers and Rising Star does a great job highlighting these aspects.\n\n***CryptoBrewMaster*** - lets players set out to collect ingredients, upgrade their brewery, and craft their own beer! The main purpose behind CryptoBrewMaster is to create a game that is not only fun but teaches aspiring craft beer brewers the ins-and-outs of beer production. The game takes a technical approach to brewing in regards to how players need to collect the correct equipment and design a recipe prior to creating their beer. In furtherance of their main purpose, CryptoBrewMaster also partners with different breweries, equipment manufacturers and suppliers in order to connect aspiring brewers with reputable businesses from all around the world!\n\n***Rabona*** - a massive multiplayer online soccer management simulator. Players decide how to build and develop their team, take on the role of the head coach, and manage the financials of their club. Lead your club to the top of the league and become League Champion in a game that embraces all areas of team management.\n\n\n## Health\n\nWhen it comes to your health, making the right choices and creating a positive lifestyle should not seem like a chore. Dapps like Actifit on Hive reward users for their everyday activity and transforms your exercise into a fun and interactive experience.\n\n***Actifit*** - an innovative social dApp that incentivizes a healthy lifestyle by rewarding your everyday activity. The Actifit mobile app tracks user activity and rewards users with AFIT tokens, Actifit innate token, but also HIVE, STEEM, and SPORTS token rewards on supported blockchains and partner communities. Users can sync their activity count using various fitness trackers including Fitbit and Apple Watch.\n\n## Social Media\n\nWhen it comes to social media on Hive, all platforms take a strong stance on providing their users with an open, censorship-resistant space to share their thoughts. In addition, many projects reward content creators with Hive or Hive-based tokens for their content. Take a look at the different platforms and dapps below!\n\n***Dapplr*** - the first design-based app that lets you be a part of the Hive Ecosystem. “Dapplr” is derived from the word dapple, meaning spots/patches of light or color. The design language that the dapplr team has chosen for their application is subtly explained by the name - prioritizing just a few colors and a fun aesthetic to the overall user-experience. The Dapplr team believes that details matter and that can be seen in the colorful liquid-like effects underpinning the enitre application.\n\n***D.Buzz*** - a micro-blogging platform that allows users to create accounts, join in on conversations and post their own content. The team behind D.Buzz was originally on Steem but moved over to the Hive Blockchain during the community hardfork in early 2020. D.Buzz’s mission is to promote freedom of speech and user-rights. By creating a platform that is a decentralized social-media alternative, D.Buzz supports a censorship-resistant platform where users are in control.\n\n***3Speak*** - is a place where content creators directly own their onsite assets and their communities. This platform runs specifically on the Hive blockchain and facilitates a censorship-free environment where content creators can express their views. By using 3Speak, users are rewarded in Hive tokens and can receive donations via the 3Speak token just by using the platform. These tokens act not only as rewards but as governance tokens as well where holders have a voice in the direction of 3Speak.\n\n***Eccency*** - a decentralized open-source social network built and powered by users. Ecency promotes community-building and empowering content creators through rewards on their blogging platform. By being a content creator on Ecency you can earn cryptocurrency, which is rewarded to all users for various social activities they perform on Ecency.com as well as the Ecency Mobile and Desktop applications. Additionally, Ecency’s users can also earn Ecency Points by referring their friends to the platform.\n\n***PeakD*** - a community platform built on Hive that allows users to post their content and exercise true ownership over their content. Decentralization and censorship resistant tech aren’t just buzzwords, censorship resistance and decentralization is baked into blockchains like Hive. Many platforms will say that censorship-resistance and free speech is part of their ideology or company vision. However, when these ideals get tested, companies can be quick to change their policies. On PeakD, decentralization means that users own their content and can use the tools that PeakD has to offer in a manner that they see fit. Touted as Hive’s entry point to the decentralized web, they place a high value on users having true ownership over their content, which can be seen in the way their platform is structured.\n\n***Aureal*** - a decentralized podcast platform built on top of Hive. Aureal acts as a bridge between traditional audio content creators (podcasters) and consumers by connecting them to Web 3.0. The team at Aureal aims to solve the everlasting and painful problem of podcast monetization and discovery without using advertisements. More importantly, the team strives to provide content creators with all the necessary tools they may require.\n\n## Payments\n\nWhen it comes to payments, the Hive ecosystem is constantly coming up with new ways to have merchants and business owners transact on the Hive Blockchain.\n\n***Hive Pay*** - a merchant solution that allows merchants and vendors to easily accept payments in Hive and Hive-engine tokens. With a few simple lines of code, a merchant can add a Hive Pay button to their checkout pages.\n\n## Developer Resources/Tools\n\nIn order to succeed and innovate within any ecosystem, developer tools and resources are of the uptmost importance. Take a look at some of Hive's development-focused offerings.\n\n***FullAlt*** - a team of passionate developers from the Hive Ecosystem that are creating products for the benefit of Hive and its growing community. One of their most widely used products is HiveTips. HiveTips allows people to tip any user HIVE tokens on various social platforms.\n\n***DLUX*** - an open-source project built on the Hive blockchain that started as a way for users to build, post and monetize virtual reality experiences without needing to know any code themselves. By leveraging networked A-Frame, visitor avatars spawn into social VR rooms with interconnecting portals to other places, all in-browser across mobile, headsets and desktop computers. With full Hive wallet integration, the ability to purchase and tip became a reality for VR art galleries, augmented reality menu systems and 2D web dApps.\n\n## NFTs\nNFTs or Non-fungible tokens have become an increasingly popular usecase for blockchain technology in recent months. They can be used in a wide variety of areas such as art, gaming, real-estate, and more. In addition to the games featured on Hive's ecosystem, let's look at a specific dapp specifically for artists.\n\n***Hive Showroom*** - a digital art marketplace built on the Hive blockchain. NFT Showroom runs on Hive Engine which is a smart contracts side-chain platform for the Hive blockchain. Their on-site currency is SWAP.HIVE which is a token that is pegged 1:1 with Hive. The minting fee to tokenize 1 edition is 5 Hive plus 1 Hive for each extra edition. They charge a 10% market fee for each sale, for secondary sales artists receive a 5% royalty. NFT Showroom aims to provide a platform that is easy to use and less expensive to transact for both the creator and collector and solve existing problems in the crypto art sphere.\n\n## Events\nNetworking and meeting new people is more crucial today than it has ever been. While more and more people are working remotely, the time we can  get together is even more valuable. Let's look at a virtual event put on by our Hive Partner - Splinterlands.\n\n***DYGYCON*** - a new kind of digital conference event built with web 3.0 in mind. Powered by Gamerjibe Social, the gamified expo that hosts DYGYCON will supercharge your networking skills. Your avatar can run, jump, double jump (yes you heard us right), attend presentations, or step up to a private conversation table with a new friend for a quick impromptu meeting. There will be games, giveaways, NFT auctions and more. Best of all, the 3-hour event is completely free to attend. Learn how to enjoy conferences again.\n\n## The Latest Buzz\n\nWhile the list of projects and dapps above is impressive, it is only a fraction of what the Hive Ecosystem has to offer. As MSQ continues to grow, we hope to welcome more Hive projects to our space and provide in-depth content that will benefit the entire blockchain industry.\n\n> Make sure to join MSQ by becoming a part of our growing community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/7DaFYQaPat), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq76OnPaXOnvo73sECoUcBQ?sub_confirmation=1) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HelloMSQ)",

      "body": "***Welcome to the ARK Hub! Articles found here will give you in-depth coverage, helpful information, and upcoming releases pertaining to the ARK Public Network. Today, we are taking a look at 5 ARK Projects You Should Know!***\n\nAs you take a moment to familiarize yourself with the ARK Ecosystem, take a look at this list of 5 projects you definitely keep your eyes on! These projects are a mix of independent companies building on ARK's Blockchain Platform, community driven projects, as well as two additional projects developed by ARK!\n\n## Compendia\n\nCompendia is a decentralized network where anyone can create and contribute to open databases of any category (e.g. apps, markets, cryptocurrencies, music, videos, games, etc). Apps and services can pull data from these databases for free.\n\nIn the future, Ethereum smart contracts can also use this data (e.g. for DeFi applications).\nThink of Compendia as an oracle network, but instead of serving one piece of simple data for one specific topic, the network can serve full data collections from many sources relating to any topic.\n\nYou can also think of Compendia as the Wikipedia of databases for apps, services, blockchains, smart contracts, IoT, A.I. and more.\n\nCompendia's ecosystem is powered by its BIND cryptocurrency (ß).\n\nBIND can be earned with yield farming on https://bind.farm, and by voting for public validators using the Compendia Wallet (https://wallet.compendia.org).\n\n## Unikname\n\nUnikname is a next-gen strong authentication solution with multi-factors that strengthens the security of your web accounts. The solution secures your connections, these of your administrators and/or customers, and enables instant access to your website, through the use of a personal ID: the @unikname.\n\nThe key benefits are:\n\n* Instant strong authentication that does not require any email or password / passwordless\n* Strengthening of the website access overall security\n* Untraceable and confidential connections that preserves your data\n\nThe vision of Unikname:\n\nUnikname uses blockchain technology to protect user privacy. They strive to bring a safter tomorrow to the Internet by allowing everybody to master their digital identity everywhere and at all times.\n\n\n## Radians\n\nRadians is a custom ARK bridgechain and service to support community development. It was created by two long-standing ARK community members PJ and Emsy. For early stage Proof of Concept development they offer a platform that allows developers to install their custom ARK Logic plugins on the Radians blockchain. This allows developers to focus entirely on their custom DApp without setting up and managing their own blockchain infrastructure and the associated costs.\n\n\n## Nodem\nNodem is a project created by the ARK.io team which has been referred to as the ultimate node manager.\n\nNodem is a new utility that enables developers and network validators to manage their Blockchain nodes and relays from a single, easy-to-use interface. Nodem features a rich all-in-one management dashboard to view the status of your deployments in real-time. Receive alerts, monitor resources and view logs across multiple servers.\n\nNodem not only saves time for developers but it also allows for closer collaboration by enabling team invites where you can add team members to manage your nodes as well.\n\n\n## Deployer\n\nThe Deployer is a project created by the team at ARK.io that allows anyone to quickly and easily launch a blockchain. The Deployer has gone through several itterations in the past with the first version being solely command line interface. The next version added a custom GUI but still required a good amount of technical expertise. The upcoming version of Deployer is incredibly simple and a giant step forward for developers looking to launch their own blockchain.\n\nThe new Deployer does everything from setting up your seed servers to creating your repository. The user interface takes you through all the steps where users can add their own custom parameters, choose their server provider, and launch their custom blockchain with the click of a button.\n\n## The Simplest Way to Blockchain\n\nALl projects on ARK have one thing in common. Simplicity. It is one of the major pillars of ARK and as more developers use the ARK Blockchain Framework it is becoming more and more apparent.\n\n> Make sure to check out the [ARK Hub](/hubs/ark) to stay up to date with ARK projects, tools, news, and more!\n\n> Make sure to join MSQ by becoming a part of our growing community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/7DaFYQaPat), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq76OnPaXOnvo73sECoUcBQ?sub_confirmation=1) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HelloMSQ)",

      "body": "***We have spent countless hours doing our utmost to make MSQ into an accessible platform for all kinds of Blockchain-based projects including games, dapps, services and innovative products. It stands to reason that some of these projects are already gaining traction with audiences all over the world. Splinterlands is one such project that has managed to capture the imaginations and attention of an ever-growing audience of participants with their colorful characters, accessible platform and novel approach to Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Let's put the spotlight on Splinterlands and see exactly why it's our Game of the Month!***\n\n## The Next Generation of Collectible Card Games\n\n[Splinterlands](https://MSQ.io/projects/splinterlands) takes trading card games to a whole other level. What started out as a professional bet by two technologists from Pennsylvania in 2018 has evolved into a platform that has thousands of players competing every single month. What really sets Splinterlands apart from other online trading card games is that it doesn't sacrifice the value of real-world cards just because it's convenient. By harnessing the power of the Hive ecosystem, Splinterlands ensures that every single action is recorded on the Hive Blockchain and every in-game asset is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT).\n\nWe made a short video that explains what Splinterlands is to new users\n\n![What is Splinterlands?](youtube:PkyOBguaogY)\n\nThe great thing about Splinterlands is that everything within the game has some kind of value, meaning that it can be held and used in real-time during matches, rented out to be used by other players or sold on a platform like OpenSea or PeakMonsters. In addition, different games require different approaches and strategies if players hope to win, so rewards are based on skill and tactical ability rather than random chance or automated mechanics. Splinterlands allows players to formulate their own strategy for success and accommodates the preferences of people of all persuasions.\n\nAs of July 2021, well over a quarter million dollars ($250,000) has been paid out in the form of tournament prizes and more than $5 million of value has been distributed as play-to-earn rewards. The most valuable card on the Splinterlands platform, Archmage Arius (a Dragon Summoner) is currently worth about $1 million, and with its impressive stats and abilities, there's little wonder why. Splinterlands also recently sold out of land claims for its upcoming land expansion. In the sale, a total of 150,000 plots were sold to players all over the world for more than $2 million. Land is one of the more recent NFTs Splinterlands has introduced, and with it, players will soon be able to harvest resources, build structures, craft items, create spells, and more. Splinterlands has developed from a simple concept into a leader in the NFT and Blockchain gaming markets.\n\n## Online Gaming for Everyone\n\nMaybe the best part of Splinterlands, other than its fantastic artwork and great in-game mechanics, is that cards range in price from a few cents to a few thousand dollars. This means that everyone can take part in card collecting and build their decks regardless of their personal equity. With more participation and adoption, players will most likely find that the value of their cards will increase over time, meaning that their initial purchases could be worth substantially more in a few months or years.\n\nThe team behind Splinterlands are truly pioneers in the NFT and Blockchain gaming space. Their early adoption of this now booming trend and ardent dedication to building a robust experience brimming with awesome content and opportunities is exactly why Splinterlands is our Game of the Month. We are honored to have them as part of the MSQ platform and congratulate them for their continued and growing success within the crypto and gaming worlds.",

      "slug": "supernftys-floating-heads-are-our-collectible-of-the-month-july-2021",
      "body": "**At MSQ we are all about putting a spotlight on projects that innovate and break the mold within the blockchain industry. One such area that has seen an explosion in attention is that of NFTs. NFTs have inspired a range of collectibles but what are people actually buying when they get one? In some cases not very much. That is why we want to shine a spotlight on one NFT project that is giving real value to its collectors-Floating Heads! Let's dive into it and find out why they are MSQ's Collectible of the Month!**\n\n## Let's Get Non-Fungible Talkin'\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens, or NFTs as they're commonly referred to, have experienced a wave of popularity and attention. What exactly does that mean? Well, virtually anything can be an NFT: sketches, memes, drawings, music - pretty much anything you can think of has the potential to be an NFT. Of course, the value of that NFT is another question entirely. In the world of modern art, highly minimalistic paintings can sell for thousands or even millions of dollars. At the end of the day, value is often a perceptual thing: if someone is willing to pay a given price for something, then that item must, as a result, hold some sort of value. Right?\n\nNow there's value, and then there's *value.* When it comes to the world of art or at least digital art, NFTs get really interesting. So what gives a piece of art value? While this may be a contentious issue, it's safe to say a few criteria give some forms of art like Michelangelo's David or Picasso's Guernica significant and enduring value. For one, classic pieces were created by masters of their craft who were practically unmatched in their skill and vision. In addition, these works are one-of-a-kind: completely original and irreplaceable in terms of their composition, context and cultural significance.\n\nNaturally, some kinds of work belong to a nation or even the world as a whole, but some extraordinary pieces of art are held by collectors who pay a handsome fee for the privilege and exclusivity of ownership. While anyone can buy a print of a painting or even download a JPEG of it, only one person can ever own the original.\n\n## They All Float Down Here\n\nNot all digital art is equal: a JPEG is not the same as a video file, nor is a 3D sculpture the same as a fully animated sequence. Some kinds of work require more than just skill and know-how - what really sets industry leaders apart from their contemporaries is novelty, rarity and applicability. A perfect example of where all three of these additional qualities can be seen in abundance is in Super Nfty's Floating Heads.\n\n> ***Find our more about SuperNfty by visiting his site here: https://lynkfire.com/SuperNfty***\n\n[The Floating Heads](https://MSQ.io/projects/super-nfty-floating-heads) created by Super Nfty are all one-of-a-kind: a total of 264 will ever be produced, never to be repeated. Each Floating Head is hand-modeled in VR and has its own unique characteristics and personality. Floating Heads are not randomly generated or produced using some kind of complex algorithm but made with care and precision by very human hands. The result is a piece of 3D digital art that is completely original and part of a limited collection of similar expertly crafted characters.\n\nThere's more to Floating Heads though. When you purchase one, you receive the following:\n\n- a commercial license for your Floating Head\n- a 3D printable file (.stl)\n- the original metaverse models (.usdz, .glb)\n- the original video file (.mp4)\n\nThat's right, when you purchase a Floating Head, you can take the model and have it 3D printed. Since you own the commercial license, you have the opportunity to reproduce and distribute real-world duplicates of your Floating Head to turn a profit. If that doesn't grab you, there's always just 3D printing a Floating Head for the sake of posterity!\n\n> ***Check out SuperNfty's Floating Heads Collection on [Opensea.io](https://opensea.io/collection/super-nfty-floating-heads)***\n\nFloating Heads are also fully functional. This is because you get the USDZ and GLB files so that your Head can be displayed in the metaverse or in Augmented Reality (AR). If you take things one step further and have your model rigged, it can be employed as a working, animated avatar that can be used for V-tubing, Facerig or VRchat.\n\n## How Does Floating Heads Work?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there will only ever be 264 Floating Heads. Every Friday, 7 new Heads are minted. Over the course of the following week, any unclaimed and unsold Floating Heads will gradually drop to a price of around 0.1 ETH.\n\nPrices for Floating Heads 101 to 150 start at 0.25 ETH while Heads 151 to 200 start at 0.3 ETH. Heads 200 to 260 will begin at 0.5 ETH before slowly dropping down to 0.1 ETH. Heads 261 to 264 will not be sold to the public (at least, not at present). Super Nfty Floating Heads can be purchased via OpeanSea - at the time of writing, around 161 items have been made available for purchase and 93 individuals own Floating Heads.\n\nNew features and unlockables are in the cards for Floating Heads in the future, and if users have any original ideas for rewards or functions, the project's creator (SuperNfty) encourages them to voice their opinions and have their suggestions heard - the community is very much appreciated and serves an important role in the Floating Heads experience.\n\n## Super Nfty Floating Heads is our Collectible of the Month!\n\nWe might not be connoisseurs, but we here at MSQ know a good thing when we see it. Super Nfty Floating Heads are original, creative and have a lot of value to offer users across the crypto sphere and the world as a whole. The fun designs, pop culture references and quirky animations make Floating Heads one of the most nuanced and interesting projects in the Blockchain business. \n\nWe are losing our heads (see what we did there?) over Super Nfty Floating Heads. With some fun mechanics, great designs and provably rare characteristics, Super Nfty Floating Heads is easily one of the coolest projects around - we are really excited to see what the future has in store and have little doubt that we will not be disappointed. Just take a look at their roadmap for all the exciting things in development:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/H9Z7SlJ.png)\n\nCongratulations once again to SuperNfty and his hard work in creating such a unique collectible!",

      "body": "***When creating MSQ, we strived to create a place that would highlight many of the different projects, games, and services within the blockchain industry. From that desire, came opportunities to shine a spotlight on projects which are succeeding in different ways. For Travala.com, they have created an ecosystem which allows newcomers to not only use cryptocurrency, but give them a better alternative to online travel agencies and antiquated rewards programs. Let’s celebrate Travala.com this month and see what makes them stand out!***\n\n## Travala.com - an Industry Leader in Blockchain-based Travel \n\nFrom their early roots in 2017, [Travala.com](https://MSQ.io/projects/travalacom) has grown from a small start-up to an industry leader in travel. If you take a look at their offerings, you will find that they offer over 2 million properties covering over 90,000 destinations across 230 countries. \n\nWe created a short and informative video highlighting their platform below:\n![What is Travala.com?](youtube:riBFKf5SiSg) \n\nBlockchain technology has been a part of Travala.com’s DNA from the very beginning and underpins their entire platform. However, where Travala.com shines is in its simplicity. The platform is incredibly easy to use and users can book their vacations using traditional payment methods or over 40+ different cryptocurrencies. \n\nNo matter what method you choose to book your next vacation, users with an account on Travala.com will earn rewards for traveling and be eligible to join the platform’s Smart Program. By participating in these programs, discounts can reach up to 13% based on your level within the program.\n\n> ***Ready to see the world? Use our [referral link](https://www.travala.com?ref=msq) and book your next vacation today!***\n\nWhere this differs from traditional online travel agencies is that your membership level does not expire. Many traditional airlines for example give customers status credits which allow them to progress to higher membership levels when traveling. However, these credits expire, and many individuals are not in the position or need to travel multiple times a year. This can also be seen on traditional booking platforms that assign members different tiers based on how frequently they book accommodations. These membership tiers are usually contingent upon continued bookings. Travala.com’s approach is not only customer-focused but it uses cryptocurrency in a way that makes traditional online travel agency reward programs look outdated by comparison.\n\n## The Future of Travel\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, the travel industry was one of the most impacted sectors of the global economy. While Travala.com also felt these effects, they took this period to build their solutions and refine their goals. Today, they have had 4,894% year-on-year growth with no signs of slowing down as the world gets ready to travel again. \n\nTheir success can be attributed to their hardworking team and the amount of collaboration they have had within the industry. 70% of all purchases made on the platform are done so in cryptocurrency, and their rewards program is also powered by their native cryptocurrency AVA. So while the platform has a host of benefits for crypto users, it never becomes overly-complicated and serves as a gateway for individuals who are learning about cryptocurrency for the first time. \n\nRecently, we had the opportunity to sit down with Travala.com’s Chief Marketing Officer -- Ben Rogers. During our interview we discussed what makes Travala.com so unique, how they navigated the pandemic, and their future plans. \n\nYou can watch the interview in its entirety below:\n![A MSQ Special Interview with Travala.com CMO Ben Rogers](youtube:spWM8iQbmwA)\n\nWe are incredibly proud to have Travala.com as a partner on MSQ and as our project of the month. Make sure to head over to their website for a free account and a special discount for MSQ users.",

      "body": "**Today we are glad to welcome and feature one of the top and most ambitious games built on Solana - Star Atlas! Let’s learn about them today and how they are going to change MMO**\n\n## Space: The Crypto Frontier\n\nHumanity has marveled at the vastness of the cosmos since time immemorial. With an infinite unexplored territory, space truly is a wonder beyond comparison. Now imagine a reality in which humanity has traversed those fathomless tracts of nothingness and expanded its influence to the farthest  stars - but it is not alone within this realm of exploration and  technologically-driven conquest. In this reality, there are others that compete with humans for dominance and use whatever tactics they have at their disposal to emerge victorious: Welcome to [Star Atlas](https://MSQ.io/projects/star-atlas).\n\nSet in the year 2620, Star Atlas is a massively-multiplayer online metaverse of unmatched proportions. In this distant future, three major factions compete with one another for supremacy:\n\n- Humankind who control the MUD Territory\n- A Consortium of Alien races that hold the ONI Region, and\n- Sentient Androids that inhabit the Ustur Sector\n\nThese warring factions are in relentless conflict with one another for resources, territorial conquest and political domination. Players have the option to join up and become a citizen of one of these groups, giving them the power to influence the final outcome of this titanic interstellar struggle.\n\nStar Atlas lets players captain their own spaceship, choose their crew, modify and upgrade their gear and battle strategically with adversaries in order to increase their status and power within the metaverse. All ships, space stations and land installations are retrofitted with a wide array of weapons and shields for attack and defense purposes.\n\nGoing beyond combat and conquest, the metaverse is also a home and an epicenter of entertainment. It is where its citizens go to socialize in the taverns of deep space outposts, visit their friends and relax in enormous floating space cities. It is where they enjoy artistic performances and visit the arena to see the galactic champions clash for prestige and power.\n\nGameplay is real-time and leverages blockchain technology to give players ownership of valuable in-game assets that they can use to one-up their foes and augment their strategies. All assets are delivered to players as direct-owned Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Players have total control over their in-game assets and are able to trade, upgrade, purchase and convert their assets into usable items or real-world currency if they so desire.\n\n## The Future of Gaming Tech\n\nStar Atlas is an experience unlike any other: Built using Unreal Engine 5's Nanite, cinema-quality game visuals can now be rendered and used to immerse the player in a highly realistic world that stretches the limits of the imagination. Nanite graphics technology has been in development for well over a decade, and thanks to some recent breakthroughs, the technology is finally ready for implementation. By harnessing only the most cutting-edge technology, Star Atlas is ready to set itself apart from other blockchain-based games and stand proud as the benchmark against which other games are measured.\n\nIn terms of decentralization, Star Atlas aims to deliver a  'largely serverless' experience. Thanks to Solana's high throughput rate, 50,000 transactions can be processed per second. This rate is set to increase as the network expands and more projects make use of the Solana ecosystem. This feature means that in-game interactions and exchanges can be recorded in real-time and effectively circumvents the need for a reliable traditional server backend for online multiplayer games.\n\nStar Atlas makes full use of blockchain technology since it is a decentralized, immutable database that is secured by the network itself. In addition to this, the bigger the network gets, the more secure it becomes. As a result of its unalterable and decentralized nature, any data that is stored on the blockchain is a digital form of a tangible asset. What this means is that assets on a blockchain cannot be copied or destroyed. While this makes currency viable, Star Atlas provides users with Non-Fungible blockchain units to represent their assets.\n\n## Why Solana?\n\nSolana's ecosystem is highly-developed and remarkably fast. It is also highly scalable, secure and censorship-resistant, making it the ideal platform upon which to build Star Atlas. In anticipation of massive uptake and growth, it is important that Star Atlas considers the long-term trajectory of the project - once development is complete, it is simply the first of many steps towards a replete, complex and thriving metaverse that is a virtual manifestation of a real-life economy. With many different actors and roles planned, Star Atlas requires a platform that is capable of helping it realise its full potential.\n\nThe gameplay, mechanics and utter complexity of Star Atlas make it one of the most original and ambitious projects not only in the cryptosphere, but the world as a whole. Solana is one of the fastest growing ecosystems on the market and is up to the task to bring the sprawling world of Star Atlas to life.\n\n## Star Atlas on MSQ\n\nWe will have a variety of different projects under the Solana Hub that highlight the innovation and use-cases for the Solana ecosystem. With new projects being announced every day, it's often overwhelming and time-consuming getting all the information necessary to understand how things work. In the Solana Hub you'll find some of the top projects from Solana's ecosystem as well as informative news articles and videos that will guide you along the way.\n\nWe are honored and privileged to welcome Star Atlas to MSQ. MSQ will bring a host of innovative projects, businesses, services and individuals together on one expertly-curated and ever-evolving platform. MSQ simply wouldn't be complete without amazing games like Star Atlas. So welcome Star Atlas - fire up your warp engines, set a course and let's conquer the stars!",

      "body": "**As MSQ continues to develop and grow, we want to share some of the amazing projects and services that are joining us with you. Today we welcome Ramp DeFi to MSQ!**\n\n## What is Ramp DeFi?\n\n[RAMP DeFi](https://MSQ.io/projects/ramp-defi) is a multi-chain optimized lending platform that aims to give users the highest deposit yields and lowest borrowing fees on collateral assets within Binance Smart Chain and Polygon. \n \nBacked by world-class investors, RAMP is a collateralized stablecoin solution that is similar to Maker but differs since assets in the protocol are comparatively more productive and efficient than those found in other governance tokens. It focuses on helping crypto asset owners who are involved in staking or yield farming have their capital tied up in illiquid asset ownership positions, resulting in many of them being “asset rich but cash poor”. \n \nUsing Ramp DeFi, users with staked assets can continue to receive staking rewards while retaining capital appreciation potential on their staked portfolio and unlock liquid capital to invest in new opportunities at the same time.\n\n\n## How does Ramp work?\n\nThe way Ramp DeFi functions can be explained in 3 simple steps:\n\n1. RAMP helps users earn high-yield returns from depositing their assets.\n\n2. Users can borrow rUSD, a collateralized stablecoin, against these asset deposits to gain extra liquidity and usable capital, which they can use to pursue new investment opportunities. \n\n3. Last but not least, rUSD is transferable across multiple blockchains, which gives users a wide range of investment opportunities to choose from, as they are no longer limited to a single blockchain network. \n\nAll these can be done in just a few clicks on the RAMP V2 platform. \n\nSo what are some of the main benefits of Ramp DeFi? Check it out:\n\n**Borrow Stablecoin Liquidity**\nContinue to earn while you borrow. You can borrow rUSD, a stablecoin, by collateralizing your asset deposits and utilize the borrowed rUSD liquidity directly on AMMs, such as PancakeSwap or QuickSwap, to swap for any token assets that you wish to buy.\n\n**Cross-Chain Liquidity Transfers (Coming Soon)**\nWhile your assets continue to generate high yield for you on the native chain, the rUSD you have borrowed can be transferred seamlessly across supported networks.\nThis means that you can be staking assets on Binance Smart Chain, and minting rUSD to buy new tokens on Polygon's QuickSwap!\n\nRamp DeFi focuses on empowering users with access to a global, blockchain-agnostic liquidity network. rUSD can be minted on Binance Smart Chain and Matic, with more chains in the near future.\n\n## Working with Ramp DeFi\n\nRamp DeFi is open to proposals and seriously considers partnerships with innovators and thinkers in the cryptosphere. Collaboration is a major part of their strategy, and by leveraging the best minds across the globe, Ramp DeFi hopes to expand their offerings and bring their users even more tailor-made services. Should anyone wish to contact Ramp DeFi regarding partnerships, media appearances or opportunities to collaborate, an email can be sent directly to team@rampdefi.com to get the conversation started!\n\n\n\n## Ramp DeFi on MSQ\n\nOnce MSQ is live, we will set to work onboarding all of the great projects we have joining us. MSQ is also building a wealth of informative, educational content in the form of short videos that dive into the finer details of everything crypto: projects, terminology, platforms and tokens - MSQ provides you with everything you'll need to know about the ever-expanding world of crypto!\n\nIt goes without saying that we are honored to have Ramp DeFi joining us on MSQ and cannot wait to see what they have in store for the crypto community.",

Whether its their art, their exciting communities, or the unique things planned in their projects, there is definitely something here to grab your interest.***\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OgUOhQH.png)\n\n\nWe know that all dogs go to heaven but not all dogs get to become NFTs. Only the best of good bois and girls get to become that. \n\nRecently, we stumbled upon a collection of 10,000 art pieces known as [The Doge Pound](https://thedogepoundnft.com/). These pieces are carefully chosen by Professor Elon. Probably no relation to the CEO of Tesla but we cannot confirm at this time. Each doge is thoughfully designed and grants its holder commercial rights as well as entry into the Doge Pound gang. \n\nWhen it comes to artwork establishing provenance, or the place of origin, is especially important. Doge Pound doggos are no different. Each unique Doge image is hashed using SHA-256 algorithm. You can check out the final provenance record stored on the [collection's smart contract](https://thedogepoundnft.com/provenance).\n\nPerhaps the genius of Doge Pound NFTs lies in the ability to actually pet the NFTs themselves. Where else can you possibly do that?!\n\n[Pet the Doggos](https://thedogepoundnft.com/doggo) you know you want to.\n\nThe team behind the Doge Pound has plenty of things planned around their project in the coming months. Most importantly though, they are looking to partner with a charity that helps doggos from all around the world. \n\nIn terms of longegivity the project is already establishing a community grant fund with a starting amount of $30,000. This will be a way for artists, developers, and other individuals to create utility or additional art for the Doge Pound community. In addition, 2.5% of OpenSea fees will go directly to the community  grant program forever. \n\nWith things like merch (for hoomans and for dogs), metaverse items, and access to limited apparel on the way, there is more than one reason here to wag your tail. \n\nYou are still early if you want to [mint](https://thedogepoundnft.com/#buynow) your own doge. Currently only 29% of the total doggos have been minted.\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](http://ourvillage.substack.com/) and don't forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).*",

      "name": "Rabbit College Club - The NFT Drop that Broke Ethereum",
      "slug": "rabbit-college-club-the-nft-drop-that-broke-ethereum",
      "body": "Remember when they said NFTs were dead!? I think we can officially put that statement to bed now. For anyone who follows the NFT space, it comes as no surprise that there were over 7 major new drops yesterday across a wide range of niche markets. \n\n***One of them absolutely demolished the Ethereum network.***\n\nLet's take a look at the [Rabbit College Club](https://rabbitcollegeclub.com/) and what actually happened in this epic sell-out. \n\n## What is Rabbit College Club?\n\nRabbit College Club is a generative NFT project featuring 10,000 cute cartoon rabbits with over 163 different available traits that live on the Ethereum blockchain. They come with access to the \"College Club\" and grant the holder the commercial and creative rights to the character, which is one of the big selling points of NFTs. \n\nWhile they offer a roadmap featuring a merch store, raffles, liquidity pools, and even an augmented reality mobile app, everyone is really just in it for the cute rabbits. We have seen a lot of cartoon animals lately, but Rabbit College Club strikes a nice balance somewhere in between [Bored Apes](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/) and [Cool Cats](https://coolcatsnft.com/) on the cuteness scale. \n\nWhile you could argue they are just another generative project in a sea of similar ideas, what you can't argue is whether or not the project is a success. Let's take a look at the NFT drop that literally BROKE Ethereum and completely sold out in just 23 minutes. \n\n## The Day Ethereum Stood Still\n\nNot since [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) have we seen such an insane rush towards cartoon animals. The Rabbit College Club NFT Drop sold out in just 23 minutes and in doing so, bricked the entire Ethereum network. \n\nSo many users were attempting to buy these little rabbits that the Ethereum fees at one point were upwards of $100 just to get a transaction through and the network was still stopped dead in it's tracks. A huge number of users were complaining on twitter that they submitted a transaction at launch only to have it fail 15 minutes later. Collectors were actually spending 2x more on fees in some cases than the actual cost of the rabbits themselves. \n\nLet's take a look at some preliminary numbers on RCC and just how successful the sale was. \n\n**Initial Sale:** \n\n- Rabbits Released: 10,000\n- Iniitial Price: 0.02 ETH + Gas\n- Sell-out: 23 Minutes\n- Total Earnings: 200 ETH (~$390,000)\n\n**Secondary Market:**\n\n(as of 12:15pm on 7/15/2021)\n\n- Owners: 950\n- Floor Price: 0.05 ETH\n- Volume Traded: 85.3 ETH\n\nWhile this is a huge success for the RCC team and we are really excited for them, it does put all eyes squarely on the upcoming network upgrades and whether or not they will improve the situation. \n\nIf this continues, will we see more NFT Drops launching on Polygon, Wax, or other networks? Only time will tell but it would be a safe bet to say that this sell-out may have re-opened some eyes on the subject. \n\n## Why Rabbit College Club Was a Success\n\nWhile it will take a lot more than a day to analyze the entire situation and the hype leading up to the sale, there are a few key points we can point to that led up to the successful launch. \n\n1. **FOMO** - A lot of collectors missed out on CryptoPunks, Bored Apes, Ghxsts and even Cool Cats in the early days when they were still affordable. They see rabbits as a chance to get in on a popular project at the ground floor at just 0.02 ETH. \n2. **They're Cute** - Just like Cool Cats, RCC has a specific aesthetic that they have developed that combines a bit of cool with a lot of cute. This seems to be playing well right now in the NFT market and can be attributed to the success of projects like Cool Cats and Untamed Elephants. Looks matter, this is art. \n3. **Strong Influencer Backing** - There were a LOT of popular twitter feeds talking about Rabbits. I don't know if they conducted a campaign or provided some kind of push to get the word out, but whateve the case, people were all over it. Sometimes word of mouth and a bit of an influencer push is all you need. \n\nThe important thing to understand is that proper planning and solid marketing played a key role in the success of Rabbit College Club. With a strong lead-up to their sale, a lot of influencer buzz, and overwhelming FOMO over Bored Apes and Cool Cats, a lot of people were looking for the next big thing. Seeing it all over their twitter feed definitely helped build the hype that it just might be RCC.\n\n## What's Next for RCC? \n\nRabbit College Club announced today that the art will officially be revealed at ***6 PM EST tonight (7/15/2021)***. That will be the first time collectors actually get to see their newly adopted rabbits. Until then, you can pickup a mystery box on the secondary market at OpenSea with a floor of roughly 0.05 ETH at the time of writing. \n\nAfter that, only time will tell. Will Rabbit College Club be the next big thing in NFTs? Will Rabbits give those Cool Cats a challenge for cutest PFP on the market? Let us know what you think!\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com)  and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).*",

Buckle up and let's get into it! \n\n## What are derivative works?\n\nAccording to [this publication](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ14.pdf) from the United States Copyright Office, a derivative work is \"a work based on or derived from one or more already exist-ing works.\" \n\nLet's take Cool Cats as an example. If you look at the header image of this post, the left side features some really awesome looking original Cool Cats, but on the right side, you will notice they look quite a bit different. Those are custom 3D derviative works by an artist who goes by the handle [cfw on twitter](https://twitter.com/iamcfw). Twitter user [ILLΞWMINATUS](https://twitter.com/illewminatus) commissioned cfw to create 3D versions of his Cool Cat collection as derivative works. \n\nIn this case, cfw gets a nice commission and gets to show off his outstanding artwork and the owner of the Cool Cats gets to add these to his collection. This is a perfect example where the derivative works may increase the value of the [original bundle](https://opensea.io/bundles/9-cool-cats-3-gold-404-face-5-purple-1-orange-cj8) which is for sale. It's a win-win for both parties. \n\nSounds amazing right? Except there is one major problem; copyright law. \n\n## Legal matters matter\n\nIn most nations, intellectual property is protected from theft or illegal use without express written permission from the rights holder. This can be extremely complicated to navigate for everyday Joe's like you and I and in most cases, getting permission from a license holder is out of the question. \n\nBut not with blockchain. With blockchain, the original creator can issue a license with their unique creations. Those licenses can set out a chain of custody of those rights that follow the piece of art, in this case an NFT, from owner to owner.\n\nWhy does this matter? Well, in the case of an NFT, a copyright owner can declare that an item is or is not approved for derivative works publicly on the blockchain. By doing so, artists can easily tell if they have the legal right to create derivative works of that specific NFT and in any legal dispute, the immutable record of that declaration is available for all to see. \n\n## Interesting, But why do we need that? \n\nIf you have followed modern NFT based projects like [Bored Apes Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/) or [Cool Cats](https://www.coolcatsnft.com/), you may have noticed that a lot of users on Twitter and in Discord are offering to create really fun versions of your NFTs. These may be pixel art Cool Cats, [designer 3D Bored Apes](https://opensea.io/collection/designer-apes), or even versions that can be used in the MetaVerse. These are all derivative works of that original NFT. \n\nThe benefit of having a built in and intentional system for this is that you could also tie these derivative works to the original piece of art they were based on and make it easy for collectors to discover pieces based on their favorite NFTs. \n\nThe problem is, without clear licensing and rights agreements, those artists selling their derivative works could be sued for copyright infringement and it can turn into a mess for the industry. \n\nEveryone would probably agree that the NFT landscape is full of amazing, positive, and friendly individuals who just love art. In 99% of the cases, the intention is to allow derivative works and even encourage them as much as possible. To protect the artists behind these amazing works, it is important that the industry create a clear and concise set of protections for everyone involved so that it can continue to thrive and grow. \n\n## Yes, that! Now what?\n\nWell, it's not something you or I can easily implement. It would require industry collaboration with industry platforms. Someone like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) or [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) would need to step up and help develop the proper standards and integrate them with their platforms. \n\nNFTs already allow custom properties so it would not be hard for artists to start adding a property for \"Derivative Works Rights\" = \"Yes\" as a start. To create fully integrated systems with browsable derivative works however, it will take a much larger team effort. \n\n## Derivatives have huge potential\n\nThe derivatives market has as much potential as the NFTs themselves. If we can work together as an industry to create a system for derivative works that is as safe and easy to use as the current base NFT marketplaces are, it can take the market to entirely new levels. \n\nThe next major breakthrough for NFTs could be anything, but if I had my guess, I think derivative works have a lot of potential and will be the next major frontier for the NFT community. \n\nSo what do you say OpenSea? Ready to get started? \n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com)  and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).*",

      "slug": "the-road-ahead-on-msq",
      "body": "It's been a little over six weeks since we unveiled MSQ to the general public and started inviting users off of our mailing list. In that short amount of time we have seen users create their profiles, well-known projects establish their presence on MSQ, and we have received feedback on improving the multiple systems on the platform. Let's dig in and find out what we've learned so far and what is yet to come on the road ahead. \n\n## What have we learned?\n\nIn order to test MSQ we have been inviting users from our mailing list in batches. We have now invited 100% of the mailing list and appreciate all of the support and positive feedback. Throughout the onboarding process our team has been keeping a close eye on any bugs that pop up and squashing them as quickly as possible. \n\nWhat have we learned? That you guys really want 'Dark Mode'. We hear you, it's definitely on the list. In addition we've used this time to fix reported issues on the platform, add more features to our homepage including our Monthly Spotlight, and tweaked user profiles and hub pages for a more streamlined experience.  \n\n## The Monthly Spotlight\n\nOn MSQ we wanted to go above and beyond on educating everyday users on the impressive things going on within the blockchain industry. In order to accomplish that goal and also highlight the different projects joining MSQ we created the Monthly Spotlight. On July 1st, we announced our monthly spotlight which highlights a project, game, and collectible that are innovating and pushing blockchain tech further with their contributions. Check out the projects that made it into the Monthly Spotlight for July:\n\n[**Project of the Month - Travala.com** ](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/travalacom-is-our-project-of-the-month-july-2021)\n\nFrom their early roots in 2017, Travala.com has grown from a small start-up to an industry leader in travel. If you take a look at their offerings, you will find that they offer over 2 million properties covering over 90,000 destinations across 230 countries.\n\n[**Game of the Month - Splinterlands** ](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/splinterlands-is-our-game-of-the-month-july-2021)\n\nSplinterlands takes trading card games to a whole other level. What started out as a professional bet by two technologists from Pennsylvania in 2018 has evolved into a platform that has thousands of players competing every single month. What really sets Splinterlands apart from other online trading card games is that it doesn’t sacrifice the value of real-world cards just because it’s convenient. By harnessing the power of the Hive ecosystem, Splinterlands ensures that every single action is recorded on the Hive Blockchain and every in-game asset is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT).\n\n[**Collectible of the Month - SuperNfty's Floating Heads**](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/supernftys-floating-heads-are-our-collectible-of-the-month-july-2021)\n\nThe Floating Heads created by Super Nfty are all one-of-a-kind: a total of 264 will ever be produced, never to be repeated. Each Floating Head is hand-modeled in VR and has its own unique characteristics and personality. Floating Heads are not randomly generated or produced using some kind of complex algorithm but made with care and precision by very human hands. The result is a piece of 3D digital art that is completely original and part of a limited collection of similar expertly crafted characters.\n\nAs we continue bringing on partners and different projects to MSQ, we will continue highlighting projects, games, and collectibles which are setting a high bar for their contemporaries. \n\n## What's Next? \n\nWe have an entire slate of updates coming to MSQ. We don't want to give too much away but here are some things that you can expect! \n\n### More Hubs\n\nOur hubs have proven to be an important asset for the growing MSQ community. At a glance, users can get a bird's eye view of an entire ecosystem and seeing projects, news, and informative videos. \n\nThis has also been great for making partnerships across the industry and forging strong relationships with other communities. It is a truly beneficial relationship where we help projects create meaningful content and an organized place for all their information while they help share that content and contribute to MSQ as a whole. \n\nOver the past few weeks we have been in discussions with multiple projects from different ecosystems and will be announcing our next two hubs soon! \n\n### Squares \n\nSquares are special areas around MSQ that highlight some of the biggest topics in blockchain including gaming, nfts, defi, and more! We want each square to be distinct and highlight some of the most interesting features and information in any given area. The NFT Square will be different from the Gaming Square and so on. This will be a more entertaining and valuable spin on categories where we can really set projects apart, focus in on important news, and show interesting data that you won't be able to get anywhere else. \n\nThanks to our partners and emerging trends across the DeFi, NFT, and gaming space, we already have some great ideas on how to bring Squares to life and can't wait to show them to you soon!\n\n### Learning & Discovery Center\n\nThe feedback we have gotten from different partners and everyday users on our educational content has really motivated us to take a closer look at how we present that content on MSQ. Because of this, we have decided to make it into a more immersive experience. From each hub, you will be able to click on the Learning Center and go through a curated set of videos that will teach you everything you need to know about an ecosystem. \n\nIn addition to the Learning Center we will also have a Discovery Center. The Discovery Center will allow users to view videos that cover specific projects and list-style videos. Quick videos and highly sharable content that puts a focus on not only MSQ, but on great projects within our space. \n\n### MSQ's Gamification and Leveling\n\nNot only is learning and discovering projects useful on MSQ but we want to reward users and create an entire system based around leveling and unlocking achievements. Without revealing too many of the core concepts, users will be familliar with MSQ's leveling and achievement system. Users will receive points for unlocking certain achievements for actions like following and reviewing projects. \n\nUsers will be able to display their achievements publicly if they choose, track them, and even unlock rewards. We have a lot planned and we can't wait for you to get involved. \n\n## Stay Tuned and Join the Conversation\n\n*We hope to share more with you about all the updates we have coming to MSQ soon. For now, feel free to join the conversation on our [Discord](https://www.MSQ.io/discord) and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HelloMSQ).*",

Whether its their art, their exciting communities, or the unique things planned in their projects, there is definitely something here to grab your interest. Today we are taking a look at Bruno Banana!**\n\n## Going Bananas!\n\n[Bruno Banana](https://opensea.io/collection/bruno-banana) is a collection of unique 3D NFTs modeled after a lovable monkey named Bruno. Whether you are full-blown into NFTs or are a bit of a 'Curious George,' you'll be able to see why these monkeys are selling like hotcakes.\n\nEach Bruno is created individually with a different theme, set of accessories, and background. You can tell a lot of work went into each Bruno as opposed to larger projects where AI assisted avatars are created and may sometimes end up being underwhelming. What I personally like about each piece in the collection is that it feels like a piece of Pop Art that you could hang on your wall.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bjZO-oCe2MFszi_TPrypG0fjvCcPb_dh5VC6hwjVssedlpLWIupHxWNCwmxfXdMdMZQ0taSl72XCEk1qjPswoMD_k4JA4mzECMek=w600)\n\nAll right, this is Loki...kinda cute!\n\nApparently, we are not the only ones who find these monkeys 'a-peeling.' The collection has been steadily picking up steam. My colleague Farmer Joe was one of the first few people to pick up a Bruno early last week. Since then it's been getting tougher to find them in the wild. At this moment, there are only 240 Brunos with the next drop happening on July 24th, 2021 at 2PM UTC.\n\n## Roadmap to Skull Island\n\nThe culmination of the Bruno Banana project revolves around Skull Island, a fictitious place the Brunos call home. It is also part of the project's Roadmap which focuses on giveaways, collaborations, merchandise, and meetups for the Bruno community.\n\n### Monkey See, Monkey Do, Here Are Some Stats For You!\n\n- **Total Items** - 246\n- **Number of Owners** - 141\n- **Floor Price** - 0.12 ETH\n- **Volume Traded** - 25.4 ETH\n\nWhile the Bruno Banana project is still in its infancy, you can already tell the community forming around these NFTs and the team behind them are here for the long haul...\n\n## Stay Connected\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage](https://ourvillage.substack.com) on SubStack, and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar) on Twitter.*\n\n*We will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord Server](https://MSQ.io/discord) every Friday at 3PM EST.

      "body": "The nftyverse never takes a break and this weekend was no exception! With major project updates, new drops, and all kinds of floor movement, this weekend was an exciting one. Let's just right in to the biggest developments of the weekend. \n\n## Cool Cats Roadmap Update\n\nThe Cool Cats team released a major update for their July-August roadmap. If you are already all-in on Cool Cats then the amount of amazing content won't come as a surprise to you, but if you are still on the fence, I think this is more than enough to cement Cool Cats as a leading project in the PFP space. \n\nThis update included everything from airdrops, a Ghxst collaboration, new services like an auto banner creator, to metaverse rumblings, and more. [Read the full blog post](https://coolcatsnft.medium.com/cool-cats-july-august-roadmap-2349d00a6c46) to find out all the exciting details!\n\n## Untamed Elephant Companions are Coming\n\nUntamed Elephants has somehow continued to slide under the radar a bit. While it picked up a lot of steam over the weekend and opened up some eyes, the upcoming companion drop may just be the catalyst that sends it shooting up the rankings. \n\nThe Untamed Elephants team [released a sneak peek](https://twitter.com/ElephantNFTS/status/1416429160214499332?s=20) of the new companions on twitter and they are looking great! Unlike other projects, the Untamed Elephant companions will have a unique utility where you will be able to choose to keep them as their own NFT or merge them with the original elephant to create one NFT containing both the Untamed Elephant AND the companion. \n\nWith really fun art, cute companions, and a real world goal to help the Elephants, Untamed Elephants are sure to be around for a long time. \n\n## SupDucks Storms onto the Scene\n\nThere were severl new drops over the weekend but none quite as exciting or well received as [SupDucks](https://www.supducks.com/). These cartoon ducks quickly built a lot of buzz when [@Banks](https://twitter.com/Banks) he had [traded a CryptoPunk 1:1 for a rare SupDuck](https://twitter.com/Banks/status/1416538055670865921?s=20). The news spread fast and the market was in a frenzy to follow suit snatching up SupDucks left and right putting the floor at a respectable 0.29 ETH only a day after launch. \n\nWhile the art is the real standout here, the team behind SupDucks, led by artist [@FrankyNines](https://mobile.twitter.com/frankynines) are well respected and have a lot of people ready to ape in. If you missed out on this one over the weekend, it's still early and now is as good of a time as any to give it a look. This one appears to be a big hit and we expect it to continue to gain momentum. \n\n## MSQ Giveaways Every Tuesday & Friday\n\nThis week we hosted our first giveaway in the MSQ discord. We gave away a fancy looking member of The Doge Pound and it was a blast. Thank you to everyone who showed up to join us on discord. This one is just the first of many to come so let us know what your favorite projects are and maybe we will feature them in a future giveaway! \n\n**We will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) every Tuesday and Friday at 3PM EST.

      "name": "Square's new DeFi division: What does it mean for the Industry?",
      "slug": "squares-new-defi-division-what-does-it-mean-for-the-industry",
      "body": "On July 15th, [Jack Dorsey](https://twitter.com/jack), CEO of commerce ecosystem [Square](https://squareup.com/us/en), announced that the platform is currently working to introduce a new divison dedicated to the creation of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications on Bitcoin. Much like Square's new Bitcoin hardware wallet, the new division will carry out all work in the open: 'Open roadmap, open development, and open source.'\n\n## The Growth of DeFi\n\nTo understand why Square has chosen to dedicate resources to such a platform, it is important to understand the fundamentals of Decentralized Finance, or DeFi. In recent years, there has been a growing focus on the need to develop decentralized solutions to financial services. One could even argue that Bitcoin itself was the first-ever DeFi application since it allows users to take control of their money and send it to virtually any location in the world.\n\nDecentralization is essentially why Bitcoin exists. This is no simple task however since practically every component within the legacy financial system relies on centralized parties such as banks to facilitate payments. Moreover, a plethora of intermediaries also form part of the mix. Some examples include credit unions, insurance companies and financial advisers to name just a few.\n\nOf course all of these intermediaries drive up the costs associated with financial services. They also tend to slow the process down since there are several stages through which finances must pass before they arrive at their final destination. Centralization means people have little or no real control over their money and are effectively at the mercy of entities that may not have their best interests at heart.\n\nDeFi applications provide access to financial services that are comparably cheaper, faster and cost less than those provided by centralized organizations. Additionally, parties seeking yields find DeFi attractive since they can generate returns between around 15% and 30% by 'locking' their capital into smart contracts.\n\nAccording to a [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2021/05/20/after-growing-88x-in-a-year-where-does-defi-go-from-here/?sh=5cefc17474ce) by Lawrence Wintermeyer, the total value locked (TVL) into decentralized platforms like [Maker](https://makerdao.com/en/), [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) and [Aave](https://aave.com/) has ballooned from under $1 billion in May 2020 to $88 billion at its peak in May 2021. It's clear that interest and investment in DeFi has grown exponentially, so there really is little wonder that Dorsey's Square wants to build an open developer platform for DeFi applications.\n\n## So What Does This All Mean?\n\nThe burning question in everyone's mind is, 'What does this mean for DeFi and the crypto industry as a whole?' First of all, let's take a look at the state of DeFi on Bitcoin by comparing the number of projects that currently exist with other ecosystems listed on defiprime.com:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CqQixJ6.png)\n\nIt's abundantly clear that [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) stands head and shoulders above other ecosystems in terms of the number of DeFi projects it currently boasts. Having said this, with Square's entry into the DeFi space, the expectation is that the number of DeFi apps based on Bitcoin will grow significantly in the coming months. However, according to Tally Greenberg of [Allnodes](https://www.allnodes.com/), Bitcoin will take some time to catch up and is unlikely to adversely affect Ethereum's development trajectory or price.\n\n[Taproot](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-taproot-proposed-bitcoin-upgrade), a Bitcoin protocol upgrade due for implementation in November, should make significant technical improvements to Bitcoin's core code and effectively streamline the creation of Layer 2 smart contracts. To-date, smart contracts on Bitcoin's Layer 2 (with Layer 1 constituting the primary Bitcoin Blockchain) have not seen as much energy devoted towards development when compared with smart contracts on Ethereum. Square's entry into the space should even the playing field somewhat and encourage developers to create their DeFi applications on Bitcoin.\n\n## What Do the Critics Say?\n\nCritics of the move point out the fact that Ethereum is already a major leader in the DeFi space and that building DeFi applications on Bitcoin 'simply isn't necessary.'\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5406xhK.png)\n\nWhile Ethereum may be a leader in the DeFi space, it isn't without its own set of issues. In an [Entrepreneur article](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/368299) by James Murphy, he states that if DeFi wants to go mainstream, it will need to look beyond Ethereum to ensure scalability and low fees. Indeed, many DeFi apps built on Ethereum typically have high transaction fees, are difficult to use and lack speed and security. Naturally Ethereum is aware of the issues on its platform and is working to institute its own changes to address these in the future.\n\nOther critics have highlighted that Square itself is a centralized entity and that their platform simply cannot be decentralized as a result.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rTyjt3v.png)\n\nIf dissenters are in fact incorrect, and Bitcoin's DeFi ecosystem begins to flourish, it could have a negative impact on the price of altcoins. This all depends on uptake in the coming months and whether developers will really want to build their DeFi applications on the Bitcoin Blockchain rather than Ethereum or other ecosystems like [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) for example. If Square is able to accomplish their goal and attract new developers to Bitcoin, and if Taproot really does improve the protocol as intended, then newfound interest in Bitcoin may soon manifest.\n\nSquare is by no means a little fish. Founded in 2009, its annual net revenue reached $4.71 billion in 2019. However, in Square's [Q2 2020 Shareholder Letter](https://s21.q4cdn.com/114365585/files/doc_financials/2020/Q2/2020-Q2-Shareholder-Letter-Square.pdf), they reported a net loss of $106 million in Q1 and a further net loss of $11 million in Q2 of 2020. Of course much of this is attributable to the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus early on in 2020. More recently, in Q1 of 2021, Square's net income was $39 million with revenue up 26% according to an [article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html) by CNBC's Mackenzie Sigalos.\n\nIn short, interest in DeFi is growing, and any number of scenarios could play out. The coming months will certainly reveal more details, and the markets will likely reflect whatever shift in attitude may occur in the near future. Square's entry into the DeFi space is a major move and should provide a renewed and increased interest in Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Join us as we take a look at our Discovery of the Day! Whether its their art, their exciting communities, or the unique things planned in their projects, there is definitely something here to grab your interest. Today we are taking a look at Spookies NFT! \n\n## The Ghosts with the Most\nWhen I look at Spookies I don't see a frightening ghost. For some reason, I get a nostalgic feeling of watching Halloween specials as a kid. Maybe it's the art style but something about them just works. \n\nThe collection itself has 8,888 unique Spookies that are all hand-drawn each with specialized traits and levels of rarity. Spookies are more than just cute digital ghosts, like many NFT projects, your ghost is your membership into a community of like-minded collectors and provide you access to member-specific benefits, drops, and giveaways. \n\nCurrently, the team is looking to launch the collection by the **end of July**. However, the team has assured their community that they will be keeping an eye on any drops around their launch date to make sure gas wars do not occur. \n\n## Looking Ahead at the Spooky Roadmap\n\nAfter the initial launch, you can expect the Spookies team to continue working on the project. Their current roadmap at post-launch will revolve around slecting and implementing community proposals as well as establishing partnerships with other NFT projects. \n\nIn addition, the team will be doing airdrops of additional items, Legendary Spookie challenges, as well as free canvas prints to 30 random holders. \n\nThe team is also looking to expand Spookies into the physical world with merchandise. \n\n![This is a sneak peek at their upcoming merch.](https://i.imgur.com/V2NRWVw.png)\n\n\nThere are a lot of NFT projects popping up lately and I asked the team at Spookies what they were looking to achive with their collection. This is what they said: \n\n> We wanna create nice art that is cute and makes people smile and laugh and think of their childhood when they maybe saw a drawing of a similar ghost in a picture book. Also we want it to be affordable as we think that at least some launch prices for nft projects are way too expensive to allow new collectors on a budget to begin collecting. Finally we want to create a kind and nice community to hang out and just have some fun together. ***- Spookies NFT Team***\n\nIf that sounds like your type of scene then you can learn more by checking out their [discord](https://discord.gg/3QPFqG5V7Q) and following them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SpookiesNFT). \n\n\n## Some Spooky Stats\nCurrent Launch Date: End of July (TBA)\nMint Price: .03 ETH\nCommercial Rights Included\n\nWe will be keeping an eye on this project as they get closer to their launch date and who knows...maybe even a few giveaways may be in store. \n\n\n\n---\n\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com\n) and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).*\n\nWe will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord](https://MSQ.io/discord) every Tuesday and Friday at 3PM EST. Make sure you join our growing NFT community so you can stay on top of news, new drops, and everything non-fungible.",

      "body": "The NFT market continues to boom. With generative projects like CryptoPunks and [Bored Apes](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/) leading the way, many collectors forget that the hand-drawn NFT art scene is very much alive and well and when it comes to NFT art, nothing has been quite as prolific as [Ghxsts](https://opensea.io/collection/ghxsts). \n\nThis hand-drawn collection of Ghxsts, Immxrtals, and Demxns has become one of the most sought after NFT art collections in the entire nftyverse. Unfortunately for us, along with that fame comes skyrocketing prices. \n\nThe [Ghxsts collection](https://opensea.io/collection/ghxsts) has sold over 2100 ETH in volume in just a few short months and shows no signs of slowing down. For the average collector, Ghxsts have simply become too expensive at this point and out of reach. But don't fret! We have scoured the market and found some amazing and more affordable alternatives. \n\nFor those of you looking to enter the darker, more mysterious corner of NFT art, enter at your own risk...\n\n## [S.H.A.C.K.E.R.S.](https://opensea.io/collection/shackers)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/apZn3iN.jpg)\n\nS.H.A.C.K.E.R.S (Safe House of Alien Culture & Knowledge Eternal Residents) is a series of weird and wacky convicts that have been locked up in an underground jail in the Metaverse called The S.H.A.C.K.\n\nThese highly stylized and wildly colorful demons and misfits stray a bit from the more minimal and pallid taste of Ghxsts, but have found a very strong aesthetic all their own. Their unique blend of vibrant colors with demonic imagery has attracted a lot of interest as of late. \n\nWith 80 items in the collection, a floor of 1.3 ETH, and 18.4 ETH in volume, there is still a lot of room for growth before they even come close to the level of success of Ghxsts. \n\nWe think this is definitely one to watch! \n\n## [Dead Freaks](https://opensea.io/collection/dead-freaks)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/voVbTXj.gif)\n\n***Disclaimer: I love the Freaks.*** *This is one of my personal favorites and I own more than a few from their collection.* \n\nDead Freaks are a collection of hand-drawn and lightly animated creatures straight out of your worst nightmares. Featuring Dead Freaks (vampires), Lycans, and soon a brand new series of Witches called Coven, this collection has a lot to offer those who love a bit of horror in their art. \n\nDead Freaks feature a vibrant and almost neon aesthetic with a very unique light animation touch to their art that sets them apart from the rest of the market. Let's be clear, these are not your everyday twilight inspired romantic vampires. Dead Freaks are visceral and twisted while being absolutely stunning piecse of art. \n\nThe initial series featured 100 Dead Freaks and 40 Lycans but the team behind Dead Freaks has both the Coven series and Gen 2 Freaks on the way which brings an opportunity to get in on the ground floor in these new collections. With a volume traded of 51 ETH but a floor of just 0.28 ETH, Dead Freaks are much more approachable than Ghxsts for those just starting out. They also have an awesome discord community that I frequently hang out in so if you join, don't hesitate to say hello! \n\n## [Mindds NFT](https://opensea.io/collection/mindds)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4I0MoLZ.gif)\n\nThis hand-drawn NFT art series by Dario De Siena is really picking up steam. With vibrant colors and a punk inspired aesthetic, these pieces can really stand out in any collection. \n\nWith a floor price of 2.9 ETH and a volume of 59.1 ETH, they aren't the cheapest option, but I believe they are a long term hold that is well worth adding to your gallery. \n\nOnly 41 items out of a max of 999 have been minted leaving a lot of opportunity to mint new items in the collection. You'll have to be fast though, the collection is sold out and has a LOT of interest. \n\n## [TheUndead](https://opensea.io/collection/theundead)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SfwQ58V.gif)\n\nTheUndead are a hand-drawn collection of 199 \"Creatures from the galaxy of ZocroVoid\". While I have no idea what that means, I can dig it. The NFT art here is very unique and has an aesthetic all it's own. \n\nOne of the more interesting aspects of this collection is just how different every \"creature\" design is. With each being a colorful combination of geometric shapes and sizes there is a lot of variety and this approach really makes each piece stand out and feel unique. Being hand-drawn, there is no underlying cookie cutter wireframe here, these are all truly original creations. \n\nWith only 88 of the 199 pieces released, a floor price of 1.9 ETH and a volume of 11.6 ETH, TheUndead collection is still approachable for anyone just starting out and looking for a showpiece to add to their gallery. \n\n## [The Sick Sinners](https://opensea.io/collection/the-sick-sinners)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/s2AEf8A.gif)\n\nThis collection of vibrant and kinetically animated skulls is considered an under the radar gem among many NFT art collectors. With intense visuals and uniquely hand-drawn designs, this collection definitely makes a statement. These deathly delights are some of the most chaotically animated designs I have seen but in a good way. The sheer madness of it makes you feel like they are tormented souls and I really dig the aesthetics of it all. \n\nThe collection launched on June 15th, 2021 and has only released about 50% of the expected designs. With a floor price of 0.12 ETH and a volume traded of just 4.7 ETH, this collection is a steal and a great entry point for those looking for something unique for their gallery. \n\n\n---\n\nWhatever your style, these are some really inspiring NFT art collections to help get your gallery poppin. If you can't afford the Ghxsts (and let's be honest, who can?), then give these a look and maybe, just maybe, one of them will speak to you. Just don't speak back, they say never to start a conversation with a demxn. \n\nFor updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com\n) and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).",

      "name": "The Case for Crypto Commerce Platforms",
      "slug": "the-case-for-crypto-commerce-platforms",
      "body": "Online shopping is extremely popular and highly convenient for both customers and online retailers alike. The internet has allowed businesses from all over the world to offer their products and services to a global audience and compete with companies that previously held a monopoly in the market. Of course there are still major online retailers like Amazon.com, [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/), [Alibaba](https://www.alibaba.com/) and [Jingdong](https://global.jd.com/) that dominate the market and take their cut when businesses that use their services make a sale.\n\nUnfortunately the centralization of power almost always has negative consequences. Amazon has been accused of unfair pricing policies by Washington DC. In a [BBC News article](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57249843) published on May 25th 2021, the online retail giant has been served with a lawsuit alleging that its control of up to 70% of US online sales inevitably means higher prices for consumers. While Amazon contends that the lawsuit has it 'exactly backwards,' Washington believes the company to be guilty of anticompetitive behavior and abusing its position as a retail giant.\n\n## Does Brick-and-Mortar Still Count?\n\nWhile online shopping may be the only way for many merchants, there are still those businesses that sell goods and offer services from their own homes or rent commercial premises to run their operations. Naturally there are challenges here as well with an ongoing global pandemic, high rental prices and having to hire credit card machines to process payments. As an [article](https://blog.payjunction.com/credit-card-terminal-leasing-unethical-billing) by [Payjunction](https://www.payjunction.com/payments/) points out, credit card companies falsely advertise this service as cost-effective and trap companies into paying for a terminal they no longer need. Moreover, if a company is particularly unethical, they will simply auto-renew the terminal lease.\n\nThere are certainly many more pitfalls to consider when running a business, but what is clear is that new answers to commerce are needed. Thankfully crypto and Blockchain technology has evolved to the point where several options exist so that retailers can market directly to their clientele and receive payments immediately without having to go through any intermediaries. Let's take a closer look at some of the options currently on offer.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wxpJmbM.png)\n\n[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) is well-established in the crypto world. With 56 million verified users, it is one of the biggest resources and platforms for crypto trading, development and adoption in the world. It should come as no surprize that with its growth, Coinbase has expanded the range of products and services that it offers to end-users.\n\n[Coinbase Commerce](https://commerce.coinbase.com/) allows merchants to set up a crypto payments platform in a few easy steps. Perhaps the best part of Coinbase Commerce is that there are absolutely no fees when it comes to accepting crypto. This means that all the financial benefits and profits that a merchant earns is entirely theirs. Some of the main benefits of using Coinbase Commerce are as follows:\n\n- **Rapid** - Setting up a crypto payment gateway takes mere minutes\n- **No Charge** - There are absolutely no fees payable for using Coinbase Commerce\n- **Convert** - Businesses may sell their crypto for fiat or USDC\n- **Accept Stablecoins** - Merchants can accept stablecoins such as USDC and DAI as payment\n- **Global Market** - Crypto payments mean that retailers can accept payments from virtually anyone in the world\n- **No Middlemen** - When customers pay in crypto, there are no third-parties or intermediaries that take a cut. All profits go directly to the merchant\n- **No Reversals** - 'Chargebacks are a thing of the past' since crypto transactions cannot be reversed\n\nCoinbase Commerce is already integrated with [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) and [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/), meaning that any merchants using either of these popular eCommerce platforms can easily add Coinbase Commerce to their stores if they so wish. According to Coinbase Commerce's site, over 8,000 merchants and counting are already accepting cryptocurrency as a means of payment.\n\nMerchants who sign up with Coinbase Commerce can do so in about 4 minutes and can enjoy a host of additional benefits including invoicing, multi-currency payments, zero limits, fiat and stablecoin conversions, a streamlined API, webhooks for charges, customized payment buttons and hosted checkout pages.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6AoEgXZ.jpg)\n\n[Crypto.com Pay](https://crypto.com/pay-merchant) is yet another platform that allows merchants to accept payments in crypto. Crypto.com itself may not be quite as big as Coinbase, but in February 2021, it passed the 10 million user mark. According to its Pay division's page, Crypto.com Pay is supported by over 30 million ERC20 wallets. It serves as an intuitive payments gateway for merchants in which they can easily send invoices and manage payments via the platform's powerful dashboard. Like Coinbase Commerce, Crypto.com Pay's payment gateway takes just a few minutes to set up.\n\nCrypto.com Pay is integrated into several eCommerce platforms including WooCommerce, [OpenCart](https://www.opencart.com/), [Ecwid](https://www.ecwid.com/), [Oveit](https://oveit.com/), [nopCommerce](https://www.nopcommerce.com/en) and [PrestaShop](https://www.prestashop.com/en). The benefits of using Crypto.com Pay as a merchant include:\n\n- **Rapid Integration** - Crypto.com Pay has been created by developers for developers in order to ensure quick and painless integration\n- **Zero Fees** - Merchants pay absolutely no fees on any transactions settled using crypto\n- **Low Fees for Fiat** - Businesses can save up to 80% on fees when settling a payment in their preferred fiat currency\n- **Seamless Payments** - Crypto payments are fast, secure and direct, meaning transactions are settled in little to no time at all\n\nCustomers also benefit by transacting with businesses and merchants that use Crypto.com Pay:\n\n- Customers can pay with over 30 different tokens including CRO, ETH, BTC, DOT and DOGE\n- Crypto can be sent to friends free of charge\n- Customers can earn up to 10% in Crypto.com Coin (CRO) funded by the network\n- There is no need to convert currencies in order to complete payments\n- Transactions are 100% secure, rapid and direct\n\nCrypto.com Pay is ideally suited for online merchants who want to integrate crypto payments into their websites. Users may also sign up to use Crypto.com Pay and earn rewards when they make transactions and transfer funds to their friends and family. For merchants and users who are worried about paying in cryptos where the price is subject to fluctuations, stablecoins such as USDC, USDT and TUSD are available as a means of payment.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yht22bW.png)\n\n[NOWPayments](https://nowpayments.io/) provides merchants with the ability to easily set up and integrate crypto payments into their website or store. Founded in 2019 by the same team responsible for [ChangeNOW](https://changenow.io/), a cryptocurrency exchange service, NOWPayments wishes to provide businesses with a crypto payment gateway that is easy to use and embed into existing websites.\n\nThe process with NOWPayments really is simple. All merchants need to do is set up an account, select an integration and decide where to place the 'Pay' button on their website. Once this last step has been completed, merchants can immediately start accepting crypto payments from customers all over the world. NOWPayments offers the following features to prospective merchants:\n\n- **Over 50 Coins** - Businesses can accept payments in over 50 different cryptocurrencies including BTC, ETH, LTC, LINK, ARK, ZIL, FTM and ICX\n- **A Range of Stablecoins** - NOWPayments allows merchants to accept numerous stablecoins including TUSD, DAI, USDTTRC20, USDTERC20, PAX, BUSD and USDC\n- **Competitive Fees** - NOWPayments claims that their fees are the lowest on the market and start from around 0.4%\n- **Immediate Payouts** - Merchants receive funds directly into their wallets almost instantly\n- **Premium Account Manager** - Businesses are provided with a personal manager and 24/7 support for any issues they may encounter\n\nNOWPayments is already integrated with a wide variety of eCommerce platforms including Shopify, WooCommerce, OpenCart, Ecwid, [WHMCS](https://www.whmcs.com/), PrestaShop, [Magento](https://magento.com/) and [Zen Cart](https://www.zen-cart.com/). They have also forged partnerships with numerous entities including [OKEx](https://www.okex.com/), [Crypto Posters](https://www.cryptocurrencyposters.com/), [AMLBot](https://amlbot.com/), [Verge](https://vergecurrency.com/fueled-by-verge/), [Guarda](https://guarda.com/), [Bitcoin Meister](https://bitcoinmeister.eu/), Travala.com and [Kun Koro](https://kunkoro.kiwi/indexeng.html).\n\nNOWPayments guarantees no chargebacks as well as instant payments and some of the lowest fees in the cryptosphere. The platform offers several options to merchants and developers including numerous plugins, an API and an invoicing system.\n\nOne of the standout parts of NOWPayments is their offer to create custom solutions for any businesses or merchants that feel they need a tailor-made answer to their crypto payment requirements. Merchants have the option to access portals for Gambling sites or Casinos as well as Mass Payments, but if neither of these avenues are appropriate, a request can be submitted directly to NOWPayment's team for consideration.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MOFjSSb.png)\n\nFounded in 2014, [CoinGate](https://coingate.com/) is a 'Lithuania-based fintech company that offers cryptocurrency payment processing services for businesses of any size.' At time of writing, the platform currently has 248,000 registered users, 1,360,000 merchant orders and carried out over 1.4 million transactions.\n\nAccording to its website, CoinGate has made 'strong partnerships' with several different businesses including [DIMOCO](https://dimoco.eu/), [Changelly](https://changelly.com/), [Elliptic](https://www.elliptic.co/), [Simplex](https://www.simplex.com/) and [DaoPay](https://www.daopay.com/). CoinGate allows users and merchants to accept over 50 different cryptos as payment and also gives them the opportunity to convert their crypto into fiat. The process with CoinGate is straightforward:\n\n- A merchant sells a product or service, and CoinGate allows any website or brick-and-mortar store to accept crypto payments from customers\n- A customer selects CoinGate as a payment method and is presented with a list of cryptocurrencies that they can pay with\n- CoinGate generates an invoice by calculating the price of the merchandise in the relevant crypto and finally providing a payment window for the customer\n- Once a crypto payment is received, CoinGate transfers the earnings to the merchant in the form of Euros, Bitcoin, other supported cryptos or all assets if so desired\n\nAs with the previous platforms, registration on CoinGate is fast and easy. Merchants can customize their crypto payments infrastructure, track orders, issue invoices and manage their earnings with ease. CoinGate also allows merchants to choose from a range of [integration options](https://coingate.com/integration) including plugins and modules, payment buttons or the CoinGate API. As an added bonus, if businesses are still unsure about using CoinGate, they can try out the various features of the platform in a safe environment via the CoinGate [Sandbox](https://sandbox.coingate.com/).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mSfdRPA.png)\n\nNot to be confused with Crypto.com Pay, [Cryptopay For Business](https://business.cryptopay.me/) is (by their estimation) 'the quickest and easiest way to get started accepting cryptocurrency payments.' Founded in October 2013, [Cryptopay](https://cryptopay.me/) functions as a wallet and payments platform where consumers and merchants can carry out transactions with each other while also being backed by the Bitcoin payment protocol.\n\nCryptopay for Business allows merchants to accept payment in several cryptocurrencies including BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC and BCH. Customers may also select stablecoin USDT as a means to pay for products if they so wish. Cryptopay highlights the following benefits of their platform:\n\n- **Guaranteed Exchange Rate** - Whether a client is buying a pair of shoes or a plane ticket, Cryptopay for Business provides merchants with a guaranteed exchange rate, carefully managing any volatility in price and charging a flat 1% transaction fee\n- **Accept Crypto Payments** - Merchants can receive payments in the form of crypto and have funds sent directly to their bank accounts. Payments are settled on a daily basis across numerous currencies\n- **Maximize International Conversion Rates** - Businesses can accept and process payments from customers across the world without having to depend on local payment methods (which are often limited)\n- **Credit and Debit** - Customers can credit and debit their account balances using cryptos. Business payments can be sent and received globally in a matter of moments\n- **Zero Chargebacks** - Merchants can forget fraudulent payments and take total control over their funds. A refund is only valid if a merchant deems it so\n\nCryptopay for Business claims they have 'the most flexible payments API for cryptocurrencies around.' The platform understands all businesses are different and offers a range of options including plug-and-play gateways for eCommerce, on-brand checkouts and rule-based processing.\n\nLastly, Cryptopay for Business offers a comprehensive back office for merchants. Here businesses can access transaction records, create sub-accounts, enable permission-based access and make use of multiple APIs depending on their unique requirements.\n\n## The Role of Direct Commerce in Crypto Adoption\n\nWhile several platforms exist to allow businesses to accept cryptocurrencies as a means of payment, it's safe to say that the vast majority of businesses have no facilities for accepting crypto. According to a [Statista analysis](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1222768/business-types-with-crypto-payment-solution/) by Raynor de Best, as of March 9th 2021, the top five industries accepting cryptocurrencies or permitting access to a cryptocurrency ATM are, in descending order:\n\n- **Quick Service and Casual Dining Restaurants** - 1,904\n- **Accommodation** - 1,159\n- **IT Services** - 1,129\n- **Public ATM Machines (Business Unknown)** - 1,084\n- **Convenience Stores and Gas Stations** - 958\n\nThese figures are an estimate, but the data is based on collated information from around the world. Another [article](https://www.ceifx.com/news/who-accepts-bitcoin-and-ether-cryptocurrencies#:~:text=More%20than%2015%2C000%20businesses%20worldwide,Microsoft%2C%20AT%26T%2C%20and%20Wikipedia.) from Currency Exchange International states that over 15,000 businesses worldwide accept Bitcoin. While this is a significant number, on a global scale, it's a tiny percentage when one considers there are some 582 million entrepreneurs in the world (or at least a SmallBizGenius [article](https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/entrepreneur-statistics/) by Dragomir Simovic claims).\n\nThe fact is that the legacy financial system still dominates the world. In addition, many businesses are sole proprietors that have little knowledge of fintech or simply lack the technical know-how and facilities to access banking services, let alone cryptocurrencies. Having said this, more and more people are gaining access to smartphones and are becoming more tech-savvy with each passing day. It's simply a matter of time before they discover new ways to manage their finances and take control of their money.\n\nInevitably the onus is on businesses and merchants to expose customers to new payment methods and more effective ways of carrying out transactions. Moreover, merchants will need to communicate how cryptocurrencies cut out intermediaries and effectively make products and services more affordable for consumers. By including cryptocurrency payment gateways into their websites and stores, businesses will expose their clients to new payment options and aid in the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment.\n\nCommunities and individuals are discovering crypto and Blockchain technology every day, and it is fundamentally changing the way work is done. As businesses shift towards more streamlined forms of payment and work to cut out middlemen, customers and end-users should follow suit as they realize the many benefits that crypto offers both organizations and individuals. This will take time, but with deepening economic woes and an ongoing pandemic, the uptake in crypto-based solutions is only set to increase.",

Your NFT in LASC acts as a key, granting you access to exclusive places within the LASC Website and Discord. \n\nThey are also working on an Alien of the Day viewing hub which will display a random person's Lonely Alien on the main page of the LASC website. \n\n\nWhen it comes to NFTs, it is interesting to see how people bond with the art and connect it to their online identities. LASC wants to take this a step forward by letting holders choose their Alien's name within their \"Name Your Alien Terminal.\" In addition, they will have a future update where each LASC owner can add their Alien's backstory into the \"Alien Journal\" which acts as an open source collection of lore for the community. \n\nThe community inside their discord is incredibly friendly so I took the opportunity to ask them some questions on why they like the LASC so much. Here are some of the responses:\n* All the hot girls\n* DJ Astro - The LASC's resident DJ who does live sets within their discord. Turning their chat into a dance party. \n* The team, the art, the community\n* Tacos\n\nOnly time will tell where the LASC goes but they are off to a strong start and their community is a fun and inviting place. \n\n\n## Super Detailed Alien Analysis\n* Total Items: 10,000\n* Owners: 1.6K\n* Floor Price: .04 ETH\n* Volume Traded: 131 ETH\n\nThe collection is currently sold out but can be viewed on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/lonelyalienspaceclub).\n\n---\n\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com\n) and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).*\n\nWe will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord](https://MSQ.io/discord) every Tuesday and Friday at 3PM EST.

Whether its their art, their exciting communities, or the unique things planned in their projects, there is definitely something here to grab your interest. Today we are taking a look at Reckless Whales!\n\n## Joining the Whale Pod\nToday I learned that a group of whales is called a pod. I also learned that Reckless Whales are a set of 10,000 provably-rare tokens. The concept of a whale in crypto is someone who has a lot of capital to invest. A reckless whale is self-explanatory--someone who blows it all on NFTs. All jokes aside tho, there are some interesting things under the surface of this NFT project. \n\n\nThe reckless whale team stresses that in addition to your avatar, having your own reckless whale comes with benefits such as:\n* 7% of all proceeds going towards an ocean wildlife non-profit of the community's choice.\n* A merch drop to Reckless Whale holders.\n* Exclusive access to the Reckless Whale Casino community and metaverse. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6WkVXwv.png)\n\nFrom the current 10,000 NFTs, they are divided in terms of rarity. During minting, collectors had a chance to acquire 4 different species of whales including: Blue whales, Humpback whales, Orca whales, and Dolphins. Each with their own traits from a list of 150 possible traits. \n\n\n\n## The Great Voyage\n\nWhen it comes to roadmaps, NFT projects have recently all opted to include them. On one hand it adds more utility to the ecosystem and keeps the community engaged and looking forward to certain milestones. On the other hand, projects will need to find new ways to innovate if they want to stand out from the current NFT landscape. \n\nThe Reckless Whales roadmap has the common roadmap items you would expect from an avatar project: \n* Giving a percentage of proceeds to chairty \n* Merchandise\n* Airdrops for holders\n* and Future interactive events.\n\n\nA lot of NFT projects are learning on the job it seems and will need time to find their footing or flippers if they are whales. \n\n\n## Reckless Whale Stats\nTotal Items: 10,000\nOwners: 1.6K\nFloor Price: <0.01 ETH\nVolume Traded: 127 ETH\n\nThe collection is currently sold out but can be viewed on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/recklesswhales).\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com\n) and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).*\n\nWe will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord](https://MSQ.io/discord) every Tuesday and Friday at 3PM EST.

      "name": "Blockchain Governance: Is It Even Working?",
      "slug": "blockchain-governance-is-it-even-working",
      "body": "Blockchain governance aims to put control back in the hands of the users through voting with their tokens before any changes can be approved and implemented on the network. But does it work? Let's examine the effectiveness of Blockchain governance systems using governance events such as the Axie Infinity proposal on PacakeSwap, which failed to pass.\n\n## What is Axie Infinity?\n\nAxie Infinity is a digital pet universe where players battle, raise, and trade fantasy creatures called Axies. Axie Infinity takes full advantage of Blockchain technology and gives players full ownership over their in-game assets. Learn more about Axie Infinity in this [MSQ video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kPRnA929x0).\n\n## AXS and the PancakeSwap Proposal\n\nThe native token of Axie Infinity, AXS, launched on Binance Smart Chain on July 16, 2021. Shortly thereafter, a proposal came forth to stake AXS and earn CAKE. This is a common method for users of PancakeSwap to enjoy rewards from the platform. Users can stake various cryptoassets and earn CAKE, the native token of the decentralized exchange. However, holders of CAKE vote through Blockchain governance on these types of decisions.\n\nUnfortunately, the majority of CAKE voters did not find the proposal attractive and voted it down. Most believed that a 'stake Token X to earn CAKE' pool will only contribute to inflation and dilute the value of their holdings.\n\n## By the Numbers\n\nA total of 456 holders participated in the voting exercise. 77.68% with total weighted votes of 1,426,903.601 voted against the proposal, and only 22.32% with total weighted votes of 409,982.508 voted in favor of it. Even though Axie Infinity is a gaming platform with a large and active community, only 456 CAKE holders participated.\n\n## Why the Proposal Failed\n\nOne of the major reasons why this proposal failed to pass is that CAKE holders do not like a 'stake to earn CAKE' arrangement, as they believe it will only lead to more inflation and dumping of CAKE which will dilute their holdings. They’re more receptive to 'stake CAKE to earn something else' and similar arrangements, hence the lack of interest in the new pool.\n\nSecondly, only a maximum of 20 AXS (about $440 at the time of this article) can be staked per wallet, which is not attractive to most people.\n\nFurthermore, the reward amount is limited to just 8,000 CAKE (about $50,000) and the pool will only be active for 7 days. This doesn’t feel like a serious farming opportunity, but more of a marketing and publicity move.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, the level of participation was extremely low. As mentioned earlier, of the 465,534 addresses holding CAKE only 456 participated in the voting exercise. That's just shy of 0.1% of holders.\n\n## Whale Spotting & Empty Polling Places\n\nMost of the wallets who voted are owned by whales with strong voting power, which calls to question the effectiveness of on-chain governance in the first place, as a true representation of what the community wants. Is the voting system effective, when only a few seemingly survivalist users dictate what changes are implemented on the protocol? How effective are Blockchain governance systems in achieving their intended purpose?\n\nOn-chain governance is a way to democratize Blockchain protocols and give users the power to determine the future direction of the projects. However, all too often it seems most holders are investors who are more interested in maximizing their future profits, caring less about other matters such as governance.\n\nThey’re disinterested in actively participating in protocol governance and concerned mostly with the token’s price performance. This lack of interest leaves the whales and a few users to dictate the direction of the project for whatever personal agenda they have.\n\nTake the [proposal to support Axie Infinity on PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/QmVNWTbHwVFDYJXvgPMeVsGFBfPkrD9XmonnsJvY11u9Uo) as an example. Less than 0.1% of all CAKE holders participated in the voting exercise which makes it not even remotely democratic. As a result, a tiny fraction of the community and holders with a sizable share of the governance token could easily manipulate the voting process for their own purposes.\n\n## What to Do?\n\nThis problem can be effectively addressed through:\n\n* Continuous education of the average user on the importance of voting participation and simplifying the voting process for non-technical users.\n* Creating some small reward system for governance participants. This will go a long way in getting more users to participate as they see there’s something to be gained, in addition to making their voice heard and accounted for.\n* Restructuring voting systems to reduce possible whale manipulations as much as possible and encourage all holders to participate.\n\n\nOne Blockchain project is tackling this lack of governance participation head-on. [Ravencoin](https://ravencoin.org) has a messaging system for token creators on its Blockchain. This system can send notifications to holders of the project’s token about ongoing and upcoming voting exercises. Thus, 'Get Out and Vote' campaigns can execute directly on top of the Ravencoin protocol and reach all holders of a particular token on Ravencoin.\n\nThe idea is to get as many users as possible to be actively involved in on-chain voting activities, because it is then that a protocol can be said to be truly 'democratic' and decentralized.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOn-chain governance and voting is the way to decentralize the management of Blockchain protocols and give users and holders the power to contribute to shaping the future of the project.\n\nExperiences with existing governance systems have shown that there is still a lot left to be done to make on-chain governance more effective. However, as Blockchain projects work to address these challenges, who knows? We may hear talk at the workplace watercooler or in the Uber pool home about the latest token governance proposal. Projects just need to continue to innovate in providing the tools to 'Rock the Vote.'\n\nWhat do you think about current Blockchain voting systems?

Whether its their art, their exciting communities, or the unique things planned in their projects, there is definitely something here to grab your interest. Today we are taking a look at the Vogu NFT Collection.\n\n\n## What is the Vogu NFT Collection?\nThe Vogu NFT collection is comprised of 7,777 unique robot avatars called TARS (Tether Assisted Robotic Skeletons). In this futuristic world humans live in an alternate version of the Milky Way galaxy after a mass migration to the stars due to centuries of \"climate destruction, nuclear war, and unchecked industrial sprawl.\"\n\nMuch like how many NFTs act as a person's entry or access into a special club or group, TARS allow humans to experience the world through their personal robots. The Vogu Collective is being positioned as this multimedia universe that weaves together characters, stories, and lore. When asking the team about what this means for supporters of the collection they responded that: \n\n> We [the Vogu NFT Project] will tell stories as we do our PFP project. Those stories will continue and cross over into any other medium. So if we do a graphic novel or an animation, the community will see themes from the PFP project continue. - *Tackzy, Vogu NFT Collection Discord Admin*\n\n\n\n## NFTs and World Building\n\nFrom the moment you glance at the Vogu NFT Collection and step into their discord, one thing is apparent--the team is putting a lot of work into the lore behind the project. One channel in their discord is named \"The TAR News Network\" and has a sole \"robotics journalist\" named Bugle who sets the scene for newcomers and ties the release of the Vogu NFT to world events in the project's lore. \n\nAccording to the lore, the 7,777 unique TARS were minted during a ransomware attack on The Vogu Collective's manufacturing headquarters. As a result, the company decided to go forward with a product-blind sale. \n\nAs more NFT projects drop each day, it is nice to see people engrossed within the lore and storytelling of a project. This dedication to the lore and to building a world around their avatar project adds an extra layer of comroderie and appreciation for the art. \n\n##  Expressing Yourself\n\nMany Avatar projects resonate with people because of how they let you express your own identity. Vogu makes it easy for everyone since they've already done the hard part for you, they've made 5 different collections to match a wide range of potential personalities. For example, check out their Core Series\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/s6LtZbo.png)\n\nor Maybe the Kouwei collection is more your style...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8WHNrWU.png)\n\nIf I missed the mark and haven't hit your personality yet, you can check out the rest of the different collections on their [website](https://thevogu.io/).\n\n## Important Info and Dates\n\n* Launch Date: July 26 at 5PM PDT.\n* Mint Price: 0.077 ETH \n\nYou can expect for the lore within the Vogu NFT universe to continue expanding. Other things you can expect are special collaborations with artists such as Robbie Trevino who minted a special 1/1 piece for the collection.\n\nThere have also been some other notable collaborations with artists making limited special edition backgrounds including art from Karen Jerzky, Felix from Rosko & Friends, Ethan S. Brewerton, and Tropical Virtual.\n\nWe will keep our eyes on this project and update you as the lore and community around them grows. \n\n---\n\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com\n) and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).*\n\nWe will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord](https://MSQ.io/discord) every Tuesday and Friday at 3PM EST.

      "slug": "play-to-earn-changing-the-way-we-game",
      "body": "Play-to-Earn is a new phenomenon in gaming quickly gaining traction with people all over the world. Players collect rewards in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) within a game and have the option to convert them to fiat currency later on. Amidst the global pandemic in which many have been plunged into unemployment or underemployement, this has literally been a life-saver.\n\n## What are NFTs?\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens (or NFTs) are essentially digital properties. They can take on many forms such as memes, animated GIFs and in-game assets. An NFT’s record of ownership is stored on a Blockchain, and players actually own their in-game collectibles. NFT items in Blockchain-based games can transfer off the platform and be exchanged in any open market.\n\n## Play-to-Earn in Action \n\nWhen COVID-19 hit, many Filipino workers overseas lost their jobs and had to return home. In a country with already-high unemployment rates, these returning workers faced grim prospects of finding any jobs. However, Play-to-Earn has enabled many Filipinos to earn money to feed their children and make ends meet.\n\nBy playing games such as [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), Filipinos are reportedly earning several hundred dollars a month, more than the current minimum wage. Axie Infinity is like a cross between Cryptokitties and Pokemon: players breed, train and battle Axies and earn actual rewards in return for their progress and effort.\n\nAxie is massive in the Philippines: of the half a million daily Axie players, 60% of these are in the Philippines.\n\nFilipino players typically go to local internet cafes to play on PCs, or they participate on their phones. Word has gotten around, and now entire communities are playing games to earn money. Family members are reportedly playing in shifts, racking up to 20 hours of game time every single day.\n\n## Yield Guild Games\n\n[Yield Guild Games](https://yieldguild.io/) (or YGG) is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) established to invest in NFTs. Their mission is to create the biggest virtual world economy, optimizing its community-owned assets for maximum utility and sharing profits with its token holders.\n\nYGG supports a number of games including Axie Infinity. YGG acquires in-game assets and lends them to their community members as a form of scholarship. The recipient of the scholarship is called a scholar. The scholar’s earnings are split between the scholar (70%), Yield Guild (10%), and the Community Manager (20%). The Community Manager is responsible for recruiting, training and mentoring the new player.\n\n> YGG funded a documentary exploring Play-to-Earn in the Philippines. You can view it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo-BrASMHU4/).\n\nYGG also supports Blockchain games [League of Kingdoms](https://www.leagueofkingdoms.com/) and [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/). The former is an MMO strategy game where players fight for dominion while the latter is a virtual world where participants can play, build, own, and monetize their virtual experiences according to their personal preferences.\n\nWhilst the majority of YGG members are currently located in the Philippines, it is rapidly gaining popularity in other countries such as India and Brazil.\n\n## The Future of Play-to-Earn\n\nCould Play-to-Earn be an alternative career choice that allows people to earn a decent living? The only real requirements are time, internet connectivity and a smartphone. The idea of earning money while playing and having fun may sound patently absurd to many, but the truth is that gaming is already a viable career option for many Filipinos. Value is created when communities come together and work to achieve something greater than they could as individuals.\n\nThe digital world is clearly having a profound effect on populations all over the world and helping to lift people out of poverty. As more communities come to realize this, there is little doubt that Play-to-Earn will continue to grow and may one day be an integral part of the global economy. \n\nDecentralization has allowed people to gain ownership over assets that provide them with the ability to make money and add value to society as well as their own communities at a grassroots level. At this point, Play-to-Earn isn't just here to stay- it's a new way of life.",

If we missed your collection just tweet at me and I'll be happy to add it to the list. \n\n**Let's take a look at some of the collections dropping from July 26th -  July 31st**\n\n## Whelps NFT\n\n![](https://ik.imagekit.io/cqjxdcnnf/upcomings/tr:w-150,q-95/whelps_1)\n\nWhelps is a hand-drawn dragon NFT collection with a maximum of 7,777 unique NFTs. I've seen Game of Thrones and I can't really think of any reasons to NOT own a dragon. What is cool about this collection is that you start off by minting an egg and every 30 hours (with no effort from your end) the NFT \"evolves\" from an egg to a baby whelp to a young adult and then finally...to an adult dragon. \n\n**Launch date: Between July 26 - 28th**\n**Mint Price: 0.0777 ETH**\n\n## Stoner Cats\n\n![](https://ik.imagekit.io/cqjxdcnnf/upcomings/tr:w-150,q-95/stonercats_1)\n\nThis isn't your average Garfield. I didn't have Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher starting a NFT collection and animated series revolving around stoner cats on my 2021 bingo card but here we are. By purchasing a stoner cat you are effectively funding the content. It is an interesting experiment and I can't wait to see where it goes.\n\n**Launch date: July 26**\n**Mint Price: TBA**\n\n## The Vogu Collective\n\n![](https://MSQ.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/492/Webp.net-resizeimage.png)\n\n[The Vogu Collective](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/the-vogu-nft-collection) is a unique 7,777 NFT collection featuring TARS (robot avatars) which are part of a fictional universe created by the project's founders and contributing artist. Come for the art but stay for the world building. We recently featured Vogu as our NFT discovery of the day. \n\n**Launch date: July 26th at 8PM EST.**\n**Mint Price: 0.077 ETH**\n\n## World of Women\n\n![](https://ik.imagekit.io/cqjxdcnnf/upcomings/tr:w-150,q-95/worldofwomen_3)\n\nWorld of Women NFTs are a 10,000 randomly generated collection of diverse women. People who have a NFT from this collection will be able to choose to be a part of 3 clubs (LIKE THAT MEAN GIRLS MOVIE): Royalties club where they earn 50% of all opensea royalties, Investors clubs which receives 50% of profits generated by the \"WoW\" Fund, and the Curators club which choose a NFT art piece for the WoW fund to purchase. Interesting mechanics are at play here and I believe it's worth a look.\n\n**Launch date: July 27, 9PM CEST** \n**Mint Price: 0.08 ETH**\n\n## Crazy Lizard Army\n\n![](https://ik.imagekit.io/cqjxdcnnf/upcomings/tr:w-150,q-95/crazylizardarmy1_3)\n\nIt's about time we start giving some love to lizards. Too many cats and cute dog avatar projects out there. This is a collection of 10,000 NFTs. Holders will be able to burn 3 of their Crazy Lizards in the \"Evolution Lab\" in order to create a dragon. But that's just the tip of the proverbial lizard iceberg.\n\n**Launch Date: July 27th at 6PM EST**\n**Mint Price: 0.04 ETH**\n\n## Epic Wizard Union\n\n![](https://ik.imagekit.io/cqjxdcnnf/upcomings/tr:w-150,q-95/epicwizard_2)\n\nThe Epic Wizard Union is all about a group of Union Wizards and Witches that want better wands and broomsticks. That's the hook. Besides the usual NFT project fun, you can expect that in the future each wizard will be able to summon their own NFT companion called familliars. There will also be a place for your wizardsd to preform rituals and conjure spells for items that can be used in a monthly tournament. The monthly tournament itself will be a tactical browser game complete with prizes and more. \n\n**Launch Date: July 28th, Time TBA\nMint Price: 0.05 ETH**\n\n## Spookies\n\n![](https://ik.imagekit.io/cqjxdcnnf/upcomings/tr:w-150,q-95/spookies_1)\n\n[We featured Spookies](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/spookies-nft-the-ghost-with-the-most) recently because they are just so cute. They honestly make Casper the friendly ghost look like a huge jerk. This unique 8,888 NFT collection will be launching soon and will be doing some drops for their community in the near future.\n\n**Launch Date: July 29th, Time: TBA**\n**Mint Price: 0.03 ETH**\n\n## Star Sailor Siblings\n\n![](https://ik.imagekit.io/cqjxdcnnf/upcomings/tr:w-150,q-95/sss_1)\n\nStar Sailor Siblings takes place in the year 7070 which ironically is the amount of Star Sailor Siblings you can mint. These astronaut siblings look pretty cool and I will be checking out the drop to see what the team has planned.\n\n**Launch Date: July 30th\nMint Price: 0.075 ETH**\n\n## Rulers of the Seas\n\n![](https://ik.imagekit.io/cqjxdcnnf/upcomings/tr:w-150,q-95/rulersoftheseas_1)\n\nThese mermaid character themed NFTs are part of a 10,000 piece Avatar and Metaverse-based collection. The team plans to host treasure hunts, meetups, give back to the community, and build them up the intellectual property surrounding the project as time goes on. \n\n**Launch Date: July 30th at 2PM EST\nMint Price: 0.08 ETH**\n\n\n## That's it for this week\nDid we miss any collections that you are lookiing forward to?

Whether its their art, their exciting communities, or the unique things planned in their projects, there is definitely something here to grab your interest. Today we are taking a look at the [Epic Wizard Union](https://www.epicwizardunion.com/).\n\n## NFTs = Magic?  \nWhether you are ingrained in the NFT community or not, one thing has been clear--the way these communities have managed to build themselves up and promote their art almost seems like magic. When it comes to exploring different collections, my own personal preference has been looking at collections that have art that resonates with me and a community that is excited about the future of the project. Epic Wizard Union nails both of those for me and I want to show you some of the things I am really enjoying about their project. \n\n## The Art\n\nThey say that no two wands are the same. Who said that? I don't know it was probably Dumbledore. Either way, the art in this collection reminds me of something that can be plucked from the mind of Matt Groening. Simpsons-esque? is that a word? The characters in this collection all look unique with over 200 possible traits which include things such as clothing, hats, and yes--wands.

More NFTs\n\nIt seems odd but one of the most widely adopted roadmap items for NFT projects is giving the community more NFTs. It's like buying a piece of art from your favorite artist and then 2 months later you find out he mailed you another piece of Art out of the blue. At the beginning we saw projects start offering companions and additional NFTs organically and as a surprise. Now, many projects have announced them from the start. Is the magic lost? or is that feeling still realized when these extra NFTs show up? \n\nWhat I like about Epic Wizard Union is that their approach to giving their community more NFTs revolves around their supportive community as well as utility for their upcoming game. Once minting begins and the first 20% of Wizards and Witches find their home, the team will send out 7 special holographic wizards. In addition, collectors will be able to summon NFT familiars with their wizards (NFT companions) for free in the near future.  \n\n## The Grand Monthly Epic Wizard Tournament \n\nI'm no expert on the magical arts but any tournament that has the word \"Grand\" and \"Epic\" in it seems important. The Grand Monthly Epic Wizard Tournament will be a browser bame where players compete against one another using their wizards. The game's main mechanics include the tactical management of your wizard team, the casting of spells, and luck-based gameplay. The winner ofthe tournament will received Ethereum prizes and more information on the game will be revealed soon. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/luB5NiT.png)\n\nLastly, don't forget about the Wizard's Den. This will be a place where the wizards in your wallet can perform riguals and conjure spells and items that can be used in the Grand Monthly Epic Wizard Tournament. \n\nAs we draw closer to the launch date, I am looking forward to experiencing the magic first-hand. \n\n\n## Magic Numbers\nTotal Items: 10,777\nMint Price: 0.05 ETH\nTotal Traits: 200\nLaunch Date: July 28th at 4PM EST\n\n\nAt the time of this writing, the Epic Wizard Union hasn't begun minting but you can check out the countdown clock on their [website](https://www.epicwizardunion.com/) \n\n\n---\n\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com\n) and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).*\n\nWe will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord](https://MSQ.io/discord) every Tuesday and Friday at 3PM EST.

Let's take a look back on all of the action from the past weekend so you can be ready for the week ahead! \n\n## Ghxsts x Cool Cats = Winning\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XWcI3h8.png)\n\nWhen Ghxsts and Cool Cats announced they were going to collaborate on new NFT artwork, everyone knew it was going to be something special. Suffice it to say, they did not let us down! \n\nThe collab contained four pieces in total. The first of which was the [-1 Cxxl Cat](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0xfaee4b062449a24a3d0f211d08caac43ee3a1d9b/66418630152144138420887529467591841897902352589395023086471333752449146031912) which was airdropped to all Cool Cat owners. This piece immediately became insanely popular for derivative artists with handfuls of Cxxl Cat owners creating new versions of the -1 Cxxl Cat but with the traits added from their regular Cxxl Cats. They became so popular that even [Clon](https://twitter.com/cloncast), the founder of Cool Cat decided to [get in on the fun](https://twitter.com/cloncast/status/1418406402213613571?s=20)!\n\nIf the cxllab would have stopped there, I think everyone would have still been happy, but it didn't stop. No sir, it went Super Saiyan. Over the weekend, Ghxsts and Cool Cats released THREE more NFTs in the [Cxllabs Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/cxllabs) featuring unique renditions of Cool Cats with an amazing Ghxst twist. \n\nThe first Piece was the [Ghxst x Cool Cats](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/80494307024529346018053650490912529916739680814770830097664395798704696590337) piece and it was released as a charity auction over the weekend. The auction closed with a whopping [54.4845 ETH sale][(https://](https://twitter.com/Ghxsts/status/1419091928713469957?s=20)) from [Twitter user sighduck](https://twitter.com/hi_sighduck?s=20) with 100% of the proceeds going to charity. \n\nThe remaining two pieces were released as regular sales but only Ghxsts and Cool Cat owners were eligible to buy them. They each had a mint of 150 editions with the [Ghxst Cat](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/80494307024529346018053650490912529916739680814770830097664395800903719846040) being illustrated by Ghxsts and the [Cool Ghxst](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/80494307024529346018053650490912529916739680814770830097664395799804208218264) being illustrated by Clon.  \n\nBoth pieces are absolute gems and feature amazing artwork. I think it's safe to say that everyone else agrees as the pieces [sold out in just 3 seconds](https://twitter.com/Ghxsts/status/1419345789969702924?s=20) and have already seen a lot of interest in the secondary market. \n\nBottom line, everyone already loved Ghxsts and Cool Cats but this collaboration just proves why they have been so successful. They set themselves apart by listening to their communities, constantly giving back, and just being awesome people who care about their fans. What more could you ask for? Other artists whould take note, this is the way to build a lasting brand! \n\nWith that said, let's take a look at a few other happenings from over the weekend...\n\n## Joe's Hot Takes\n\n- [Barn Owlz](https://opensea.io/collection/barn-owlz) were a hot item this weekend and building buzz\n- [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) is becoming more popular with NFT Minters\n- CryptoPunks and Bored Apes continue to [lead the charts](https://rarity.tools/) in sales volume but Axie seems to be on fire lately\n- Biggest winner of last week was the 12-year old who launched [Weird Whales](https://weirdwhalesnft.com/)\n\n## Upcoming Launches\n\n- Read the [What's Next in NFTs](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/whats-next-in-nfts) post on our Blog for this weeks launches!\n\n## Did You Miss These? \n\nLet's take a look back at our featured pieces from last week on MSQ. \n\n#### Opinion Pieces & News\n\n- [Can't Afford a Ghxsts?

      "body": "Join us as we take a look at our Discovery of the Day! Whether its their art, their exciting communities, or the unique things planned in their projects, there is definitely something here to grab your interest. Today we are taking a look at the [World of Women](https://opensea.io/collection/world-of-women-nft) collection by [Yam Karkai](https://twitter.com/YKarkai).\n\n## What is World of Women?\n\n[World of Women](https://worldofwomen.art/) is a collection of 10,000 ERC-721 based NFTs featuring \"unique, cool, and diverse Women, ready to leave their mark on the NFT space\". They were released by creator and illustrator Yam Karkai on July 27th, 2021 at a price of 0.07 ETH per token. \n\n[World of Women](https://twitter.com/worldofwomennft) features colorful art and a vibrant artistic style that is a very welcome change from the copy/paste generative products we have seen in the past. It is also noteworthy as one of the first collections to be focused on Women who are typically an underrepresented category in NFTs. \n\nWorld of Women got a lot of buzz for their launch, even drawing the attention of marketing guru [Gary Vee](https://twitter.com/garyvee), creator of VeeFriends and countless other projects, who [tweeted his support](https://twitter.com/garyvee/status/1420189808882761729?s=20) of the project late into the night. This kind of early exposure bodes well for the long term prospects of the community. \n\n## Perks & Roadmap\n\nWorld of Women sets itself apart with a solid roadmap and a series of perks for owners that should get any collector excited. Each NFT has a series of traits and some traits allow membership in exclusive clubs that offer really solid benefits.\n\nLet's take a look at what you get: \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m3yrIWR.png)\n\n1. **Royalties Club** - If you are lucky enough to get an NFT that has the trait for the Royalties Club, you get a share of the actual secondary sales of the collection. That's right, 50% of all secondary sales will be split among Royalty Club members. If the collection proves popular (and it already has) that could be MASSIVE. \n2. **Investors Club** - This club is focused on the WoW Fund which will be used to invest, rent, license, and leverage NFTs as an investment vehicle. This is a unique concept so far in the space and with 50% of profits generated from the fund going to Club members, it could be a really great long term investment. \n3. **Curators Club** - This might be the most interesting of the bunch. The Curators Club members will vote each month on an Art piece valued at 0.3 ETH or less for the WoW Fund to invest in. This could be good for supporting your favorite artists and bringing exposure to some of the more indie creators out there. \n\nBest of all, that's just the perks for special traits. The project will also be creating a ton of additional utility and perks for regular NFT holders such as: \n\n- Physical Prints\n- Royalties from commercial deals\n- A special musical album on Spotify\n- Donations to meaningful charities\n- and more\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZeaLcnP.png)\n\nWorld of Women has a ton to offer the NFT community. From beautiful art to bringing women more to the forefront along with some of the best perks we have seen to date, this is definitely a project to watch long term. IF you are looking for a project to really dive deep into and join a community, this may just be the one for you. \n\n#### Quick Stats\n\n*Here are some quick stats at the time of writing*\n\n- Mint: 10,000\n- Floor Price: 0.07 ETH\n- Volume: 221 ETH\n- Owners: 2100\n\n***\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com\n) and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).*\n\nWe will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord](https://MSQ.io/discord) every Tuesday and Friday at 3PM EST.

Whether its their art, their exciting communities, or the unique things planned in their projects, there is definitely something here to grab your interest. Today we are taking a look at the Animetas!\n\n## What is Animetas \n\nWhen I think of [Animetas](https://www.animetas.io/), I think of AMC. Not the movie theater chain and one of the beloved stocks of Reddit but - A.M.C. - Anime, Metaverse, and Community.\n\nThe collection itself is comprised of 10101 unique avatars. The lore behind the collection is that Animetas are virtual representations of humans that \"minted their brains on the blockchain once Earth became uninhabitable.\"\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Bmxlw4J.png)\n\n\nThe collection was designed by [@pixelGustavo](https://twitter.com/PixelGustavo?s=20) and generated by [@cypher49](https://twitter.com/cyberh49). The art style takes cues from pop culture of the 80s and 90s. The team has strived to make the collection as inclusive as possible with 1:1 male to female ratio, representation of different genders and identities, and over 100+ types of clothing, 50+ types of hairstyles and accessories as well. \n\n## Step into the Animetaverse \n\nThe Animetaverse is not your simple avatar project. They have their eyes set on the metaverse and creating an expansive world for thier intellectual property. Things that collectors can expect after the initial drops include:\n\n* Unique airdrops such as hovercars and weapons for holders. \n* Pets for the Animetas - referred to as Anipetas. \n* Collaborations between the team and community members to make physical and metaverse merch/wearables. \n* Development of retro arcade games\n\nWhile these goals are lofty, the Animetas team is working on building out the world one step at a time. \n\n\n## Community First\n\nThe Animetas truly put community first. Earlier this week the team did a drop for Animonkeys. Unfortunately they ran into some obstacles such as Animonkeys revelaing with incorrect metadata. In addition some users had failed transactions and lost the gas fee for the transaction. \n\nAs of the time of this writing, the team created a channel for all users, collected all the wallet addresses that had issues (1,360 wallets), and already created a plan to compensate all of those affected. \n\n## When's the Drop?\n\nThe official Drop for the project will be taking place on July 31st at 12PM EST. Here are some other important things to keep in mind:\n* Mint Price: 0.08 ETH\n* Max amount of Mints per Transaction: 21\n\nWe are looking forwared to seeing how the Animetaverse evolves over time and were really happy to see a project that is trying to do right by their community.\n\n---\n\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com\n) and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).*\n\nWe will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord](https://MSQ.io/discord) every Tuesday and Friday at 3PM EST.

Whether its their art, their exciting communities, or the unique things planned in their projects, there is definitely something here to grab your interest. Today we are taking a look at the Crazy Lizard Army!\n\n## What is The Crazy Lizard Army?\n\nThe Crazy Lizard Army is an NFT PFP project featuring 10,000 lizards. The project is following in the footsteps of many NFT projects as of late but they have some interesting things going on that we felt should be explored. \n\nThe art itself is nice and each lizard is a random combination of over 150+ traits. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dLt58nE.png)\n\nOne of the interesting features we wanted to cover about this project is the \"Crazy Evolution Lab.\" This is a place where collectors can effectively burn 3 of their lizards in exchange for a dragon. This asthetically creates a new and unique NFT. In funciton however, it is a deflationary mechanism. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UQQZubz.jpg)\n\nIt is worth noting as well that the evolution is random and irreversible. \n\n## What's Next for the Crazy Lizard Army\n\nAt the time of this writing the community has been increasingly active and has already started minting their own lizards. \n\nSince launching this past week the team has:\n* airdropped 10 lizards to random owners\n* Created a memeber-exclusive merch store \n* Deposited 100 lizards into a reward pool\n* Create a community wallet\n* Started working on Lizard stories and comics\n* and more!\n\n## Some Lizard Stats\n\n* Total Number in Collection: 10,000\n* Total Owners: 1.4K\n* Mint Price: 0.03 ETH\n* Floor Price: 0.02 ETH\n\nWe are looking forward to seeing how their community \"evolves\" over time.\n\n---\n\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com\n) and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).*\n\nWe will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord](https://MSQ.io/discord) every Tuesday and Friday at 3PM EST.

Whether its their art, their exciting communities, or the unique things planned in their projects, there is definitely something here to grab your interest. Today we are taking a look at Luchadores NFTs. \n\n## Luchadores Leaving a Legacy \nOne of the most concerning things about a lot of the popular NFTs we see today is preservation. Will they exist a few years from now or will they point to broken links? It is a large problem and one that many newcomers to the NFT space seem to be unaware of as they continue expanding their collections. \n\nThis is something that Luchadores aimed to solve when they created their collection. Instead of pre-generated NFTs, Luchadores are randomly generiated at the time of purchase using Chainlink VRF. Chainlink VRF or Verificable Random Function is a provably-fair and verificable source of randomness designed for smart contracts. \n\nTherefore, not only are Luchadores randomly generated at the time of purchase, but the art and associated metadata are stored on the Ethereum blockchain. \n\nThese cute little wrestlers are 24x24 SVG art that can scale to any size. There are millions of possible combinations and only 10,000 of them will ever be minted. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AQph76a.png)\n\nFor the fun of it, I minted two luchadors - *Say hello to El Toro and Javier.*\n\n\n## The Path to Glory\n\nThe roadmap for Luchadores is a little bit different from what we've been seeing as of late. The main roadmap item they are working on is the Lucha Arena. The Lucha Arena will be a turn-based combat game where all game mechanics will be on-chain. Players will be able to choose their fighting style and manage their stable of Luchadores. \n\nAfter the initial 10,000 Luchadores have been minted, the team will introduce a Prodigy System. This system will allow players to generate new luchas to sell or grow their tag teams for the Lucha Arena. \n\nOne roadmap item which is availale now is the ability to choose a unique and permanent name for your Luchador. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8PZZHc3.png)\n\n***Long live El Toro!***\n\n\n## Stats\n* Total Items: 10,000\n* Owners: 642\n* Floor Price: .01 ETH\n* Volume Traded: 1.3 ETH\n\nAt the time of this writing, Luchadores are still avaiable to mint on their [official website](https://luchadores.io/). You can also snag some from their store on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/luchadores-io).\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com\n) and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).*\n\nWe will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord](https://MSQ.io/discord) every Tuesday and Friday at 3PM EST.

      "body": "The NFTYVerse never sleeps, but you have to! Let's take a look back on all of the action from the past weekend so you can be ready for the week ahead! \n\n## Everyone Apes Back Into CryptoPunks\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OiRGVB1.png)\n\nThis weekend was a blast for NFTs as we saw floors rise across a lot of major projects. Unfortunately for you newer collectors, none of that movement could even come close to the insane action from the OG NFT themselves, the CryptoPunks. \n\nThis weekend CryptoPunks went absolutely bananas and saw major action after a period that some would call a bit of a lull. This weekend alone we saw millions of dollars in sales as major buyers swept the CryptoPunk floor not once, but twice with major sales of 88 and 12 CryptoPunks with [some speculating](https://twitter.com/MichaelTant3/status/1421487429815611392?s=20) that at least the latter purchase was made by hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. \n\nEven [Gary Vee](https://twitter.com/GaryVee) jumped in on the action [buying a rare Ape CryptoPunk](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/07/22258452/gary-vee-pays-3-76m-for-a-cryptpunk-adding-to-his-nft-collection-what-investors-should-kno) for a hefty $3.7 million. While Gary isn't new to the NFT world by any stretch and has seen great success with his [VeeFriends Collection](https://www.veefriends.com/), this is still a notable public purchase and show of support for the CryptoPunk community. His sale contributed to a whopping $121 million in sales for CryptoPunks in the last 7 days according to the analytics website [CryptoSlam](https://cryptoslam.io/). \n\nThere was a lot of discussion last week with some people  claiming that NFTs were approaching a saturation point. While they may be partially right, it's clear by these numbers that the NFT market as a whole has legs and some projects can still garner major sales volume. \n\nThe big question will be whether or not the rest of the market follows suit and we see additional runs on other collections now that the CryptoPunk floor has gone substantially higher. \n\n## Punks Comics Debut Burning\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bZjLYdx.png)\n\nIn other Punk related news, notable NFT project [Punks Comic](https://punkscomic.com/) allowed collectors of their Issue #1 Punks Comics to [burn them](https://twitter.com/punkscomic/status/1421278393316880385?s=20) in exchange for a DAO Token. This DAO Token gives holders proportional ownership of the Punks Comic Vault. Holders have a say in the fractionalization of the vault, individual item sales, and buyouts. The Founder [DAO token itself](https://opensea.io/assets/0xd0a07a76746707f6d6d36d9d5897b14a8e9ed493/1596) is also a work of art. The design for the token was created by FvckRender. Over 3,000+ comics have been burned as of today with staking coming to the project in the near future.\n\n## 🔥 Joe's Hot Takes 🔥\n\n- [TheWolfGang NFT](https://thewolfgang.club/) launched their [Companions Pups](https://opensea.io/collection/the-wolfgang-pups) and they are adorable\n- [The Doge Pound](https://opensea.io/collection/the-doge-pound) floor has been skyrocketing and now sits at 0.80 ETH\n- [World of Women](https://opensea.io/collection/world-of-women-nft) continues to do well with a floor of 0.22 ETH and 1.2K in volume\n- [Animetas](https://www.animetas.io/) launched to a sell-out this weekend with pretty strong interest\n- [Crazy Lizard Army](https://crazylizardarmy.com/) appears to be picking up steam after a slow launch with the floor now at 0.09-0.10 ETH\n\n## 📰 Did You Miss These? \n\nLet's take a look back at our featured pieces from last week on MSQ. \n\n#### Daily Discoveries: \n\n- [Epic Wizard Union - The Magic of NFTs](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/epic-wizard-union-the-magic-of-nfts)\n- Discovery of the Day: [World of Women](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/discovery-of-the-day-world-of-women)\n- Discovery of the Day: [Animetas](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/discovery-of-the-day-animetas)\n- [Crazy Lizad Army - Evolution in NFTs?](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/crazy-lizard-army-evolution-in-nfts)\n\n## 🎁 Giveaways\n\nDon't forget to join us **every Tuesday and Friday** at **3PM EST** in the [MSQ Discord](https://MSQ.io/discord) **#NFT** Channel for NFT Giveaways!

      "name": "Putting a Block on BlockFi",
      "slug": "putting-a-block-on-blockfi",
      "body": "***Centralized Finance giant BlockFi is currently dealing with serious scrutiny from four different states over its interest-bearing account. What are the implications of this? And what does it ultimately mean for DeFi?***\n\n## The Lowdown\n\nMaybe you've already been following the controversy over [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/)'s recent regulatory woes, but just in case you haven't, let's briefly summarize the situation as it currently stands:\n\nSo BlockFi is a billion dollar Centralized Finance (or CeFi) company that basically functions as a crypto-version of a bank. If that doesn't already start ringing alarm bells in your head, then you probably have a stronger constitution than most.\n\nAnyway, they have this interest-bearing account, aptly named the [BlockFi Interest Account (BIA)](https://blockfi.com/crypto-interest-account/) that lets users earn up to 7.5% APY on their crypto with interest accruing daily. And according to BlockFi's site, there are no hidden fees, no minimum balances and no reasons to wait...\n\nUnfortunately the states of New Jersey, Alabama, Texas and, more recently, Vermont, don't share BlockFi's sentiments...at all. According to a [Market Insider article](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/blockfi-crypto-platform-texas-alabama-new-jersey-interest-account-2021-7) by Isabelle Lee, New Jersey, Texas and Alabama have accused BlockFi of failing to register their interest-bearing account with state regulators and that they 'may be unregistered securities offerings.'\n\nOver the coming days and weeks, BlockFi is due to face continued scrutiny and difficulties as these four states crack down on its business activities. Meanwhile BlockFi's CEO, [Zac Prince](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacprince/), maintains that BIAs are indeed legal and above board.\n\n## So Why BlockFi?\n\nThat really is the question on everyone's minds right now. They definitely aren't the only CeFi company in the cryptosphere, so why all the heat? Well, a little digging goes a long way, and some of the answers seem to be evident in this [Cease and Desist Order](https://www.nj.gov/oag/newsreleases21/BlockFi-Cease-and-Desist-Order.pdf) issued to BlockFi by the [New Jersey Bureau of Securities](https://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/bos).\n\nPoint 9 on page 3 of the Order states that *'The purported interest rates advertised by BlockFi are well in excess of the rates currently being offered by short-term investment grade fixed income securities or on bank savings accounts.'* It's definitely a lot more than the latter. Right now, the APY on a standard Bank of America bank account is just 0.01%. 'Well in excess' is clearly an understatement.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Point 25 on page 9 of the Order reveals that BlockFi's terms effectively mean that investors relinquish all control over their cryptocurrency and that BlockFi may use these invested funds as it sees fit. As a result, anyone signing up for a BIA is a *passive* investor.\n\nAnd get this: BlockFi doesn't disclose any of the information about how funds are being used to its investors, or at least the New Jersey Bureau of Securities alleges.\n\nThe Order goes on to disclose that, while BlockFi does abide by the rules with regards to some of its loan products, *'the BlockFi BIAs are not currently registered with any federal or state securities regulator.'* The Order therefore concludes that BlockFi sold unregistered securities and that it must cease and desist these activities on July 22nd 2021 (this date has since been amended to July 29th).\n\nBut again, why BlockFi in particular? It may simply be that the platform caught the attention of regulators first, but to assume that other platforms and crypto exchanges will simply be given carte blanche is naive at best. In fact, [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) has been the target of a veritable regulatory assault in recent weeks while [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) is facing [security class action](https://news.iobanker.com/2021/07/22/coinbase-and-top-execs-face-securities-class-action-over-nasdaq-listing/) over its Nasdaq listing.\n\nThis doesn't mean the BlockFi case should just be ignored. Quite the contrary, in fact. DeFi and CeFi companies alike should watch the BlockFi case closely since whatever rulings are made here could have far-reaching implications for Decentralized Finance and the crypto industry as a whole.\n\n## Bad News for DeFi?\n\nAccording to an [article](https://www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-bureau-of-securities-orders-cryptocurrency-company-blockfi-to-stop-offering-interest-bearing-accounts/) by Andrew J. Bruck, the Acting Attorney General of New Jersey, BlockFi is a 'decentralized finance platform,' but if we're being real here, BlockFi is anything but decentralized. Don't believe me? Well, try out this Twitter post for size:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WjXTp63.png)\n\nThe above comment is in response to a [Coindesk article](https://www.coindesk.com/blockfi-securities-law-defi) by [Preston J. Byrne](https://twitter.com/prestonjbyrne) that alleges that, since BlockFi is in the crosshairs of regulators, DeFi is next. And the main reason for this? Simply that some DeFi, uh...isn't:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HJZLOi4.png)\n\nAa Byrne goes on to articulate, if a system runs entirely on-chain with the aid of client side software, which cannot be altered without fundamentally reorganizing the chain, that is DeFi in the 'truest sense.' Of course not everyone agrees with this definition, but we're not here to debate all the fineries of DeFi.\n\nSo does this all bode badly for DeFi? Not necessarily. In fact there are some in the cryptosphere who believe that the BlockFi case is exactly why DeFi is actually needed:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/crrPyeh.png)\n\nGuzmán's observation is definitely one to take into consideration when looking at the implications of the BlockFi case. Unless you're trusting and using the protocol itself, it ain't DeFi. Is BlockFi DeFi? No. If smart contracts are not handling exchanges, and if participants aren't making transactions directly with one another, it technically isn't DeFi.\n\nThe consensus seems to be that centralization attracts regulation. It's inevitable. If someone is running a financial services business and making money in the process, they will need to abide by certain rules and regulations. The potential consequences of failing to comply range from mild to severe, so if found guilty of what New Jersey and the other three states claim, BlockFi could well find itself in hot water sooner than later...but again, this depends on the ruling.\n\n## Yield Farming vs. BlockFi's BIA\n\nWhen considering BlockFi's BIA and the 7.5% APY, you may well think that's a great return. However, in the realm of DeFi, many would consider this a feeble rate at best. In fact, some DeFi aficionados are earning up to 100% APY and, in some extreme cases, up to 1,000%. Insane, right?\n\nHow then can BlockFi be on the chopping block but not DeFi platforms? First off, there are a few key differences. In simple terms, yield farming involves users locking up some or all of their cryptoassets into a smart contract which in turn lends them to other users. As a result, users earn interest on their locked amounts.\n\nNow, remember how the whole BlockFi case means that anyone signing up is a *passive* investor? Well guess what? Anyone involved in yield farming knows (or at least should know) exactly what they are doing. They are therefore *active* investors. Yield farming is not easily accomplished and requires a good deal of strategizing and timing in order to be successful.\n\nYield farming is peer-to-peer (P2P) with no intermediaries while BlockFi's BIA is handled by BlockFi with funds being used as they see fit. These activities and 'products' are by no means the same. Yield farming also comes with numerous risks including impermanent loss, decreasing interest rates as liquidity pools become more popular and some pools turning out to be scams (or in other cases, end up getting hacked). If things go south on DeFi, there is no customer help desk to help you get your moola back.\n\n## So No Regulations for DeFi?\n\nUh well, we wouldn't say that. However, regulating DeFi is much more complicated than regulating centralized entities. The question is, as Carlo de Meijer puts it in a [Finextra article](https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/20516/defi-and-regulation-the-european-approach), 'What is there to regulate?'\n\nFor real, how do you regulate something that doesn't really belong to anyone? Without getting into the gory details, we'll summarize why DeFi regulation is very difficult to implement:\n\n- No intermediaries or third-parties\n- Decentralized networks mean there is basically no need for interactions with the legacy financial system\n- Governance tokens make classification challenging\n- DeFi runs on lines of code that execute automatically and are accessible via the internet\n- Sources of information regarding private and non-private cryptos beyond one or two transactions is extremely difficult to track and determine\n\nOf course, DeFi may be tricky to regulate, but it's not necessarily impossible. Having said this, DeFi has been created to bypass regulations and find solutions to longstanding issues within our financial system. Any form of regulation will therefore need to be balanced and well-thought-out lest DeFi simply evolve further to once again circumvent regulations and become even more difficult to control.\n\n## The Verdict\n\nRegulation for crypto has been discussed for years, but it seems for many entities in the cryptosphere, that regulation is finally here. Crypto is not something governments and traditional entities can ignore anymore, and with the economic woes brought on by the Coronavirus, solutions are direly needed.\n\nThe results of the BlockFi case will certainly be important for DeFi and the world of crypto as a whole. However, not all regulation is necessarily bad, and with decentralization and anonymity, regulation is becoming much more difficult to institute.\n\nMy thoughts? It's ultimately good news. Adversity is the mother of innovation, and so with new challenges come new solutions. Crypto has unleashed massive vaults of human potential and is opening up new paradigms for people all over the world. DeFi is far from dead: it's alive and well and will still evolve considerably in the months and years to come.",

      "body": "While early Proof-of-Stake coins such as Peercoin finally gave users options for how they want their preferred Blockchain secured, it wasn't until DPoS burst onto the scene that things started to get really interesting.\n\n_And controversial._\n\n## DPoS Crash Course\n\nDelegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) is a consensus mechanism that dictates the rules for how transactions should be confirmed on a Blockchain. This responsibility is shared with the Proof-of-Work (PoW) method for Bitcoin, or the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) method for projects like PIVX.\n\nIn Delegated Proof-of-Stake, representative node operators on a Blockchain secure the Blockchain in the interest of coin holders who support them with voting power. The labels for these node operators vary drastically from project to project. They are sometimes called 'Delegates' or 'Validators,' as is the case for [ARK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZwWtkiJn9M). Other names include 'Public Representatives,' the name chosen for the [ICON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQkO4JkxUME) project, 'Block Producers' for [EOSIO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TT4nnAEK8w), or 'Witnesses' in the case of the [Hive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVvPqCUKi30) Blockchain.\n\nRegardless of chain, the two-part mission for node operators is always quite similar— validate transactions so end users don't have to, and enhance the ecosystem. The DPoS architecture is also designed to keep the power in the hands of the people by allowing them to pick and choose which people or entities have this power.\n\nThis differs from standard Proof-of-Stake, where each wallet user and coin holder acts as their own node, participating in a weighted lottery to verify transactions and gain rewards.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/X8k5RDp.png)\n\n> Learn more about ARK DPoS in this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyC90uBKPRk) by ARK Delegate Cam's Yellow Jacket.\n\n## Shifting Responsibilities\n\nIt's pretty easy to notice that in Proof-of-Stake, the end user is responsible for running and troubleshooting the software required to participate in consensus and keep the chain running.\n\nIn some cases, that means running nodes in the cloud, and in others it means the wallet application that handles payments and transactions doubles as a full PoS node.\n\nDelegated Proof-of-Stake converts all of these complex responsibilities into a single simple task called 'voting.' A single mouse click or finger tap, and users can vote for a node operator who maintains their nodes, while you shut off your devices and rest easy.\n\nIf users of standard PoS chains don't perform the required actions to help secure the chain, the network becomes vulnerable. Thus, the concept behind DPoS is to make participating in consensus as simple and hassle-free for as many users as possible.\n\nUsers get their proper say in the network, and at the same time, participation in consensus becomes a breeze for everyday people.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/e2Ya83y.png)\n\n> Delegates on the ARK Public Network receive 2 ARK per 8 second block.\n\n## Delegated Proof-of-Drama\n\nSo, has DPoS saved the day, and is it time to roll credits? Not quite...we haven't even gotten to the second act yet.\n\nHow much can we trust the system? Is a DPoS chain properly decentralized? Can the system be exploited? What if DPoS node operators go MIA or even rogue? Unfortunately, many high-profile DPoS projects have a history peppered with drama.\n\n## 'Private Affairs, Sorry for That'\n\nIn June of 2018, a text conversation went public on Reddit showing that one of the Block Producers of the EOSIO Blockchain failed to attend important meetings and take steps to prevent a security issue. As a result, one of the wallets on EOSIO lost all of its funds. When challenged on why they appeared to be apathetic to the important meetings and issue, the BP simply came back with replies like 'I have something else to do,' and 'I have some private affairs, sorry for that.'\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gYwyYPP.png)\n\n> Snippet from the [original Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8ty13c/we_have_suffered_a_private_affair_block_producer/) covering the event.\n\nThe kicker here is that this Block Producer had access to $10,000 USD in rewards per _day_ by the network and yet did not seem to take their responsibilities seriously. This resulted in a troublesome PR fiasco for the EOSIO Network, and by proxy, DPoS.\n\nEvents such as the EOSIO 'private affairs' incident are usually isolated and shouldn't reflect on an entire network or protocol. However, there have been other issues _on the protocol level_ with DPoS that caught the attention of DPoS naysayers.\n\n## Enter the Cartels, Stage Left\n\nSome Blockchains that run a DPoS consensus mechanism allow for a feature called 'multivoting.' This means that a single wallet user can use the same coins to assign voting power to multiple node operators at once.\n\n> As a side note, a common property of a DPoS network is that voting does not send any coins to the node operator. Instead, coin balances are used to represent voting power assignable to that node operator.\n\nWhether accidental or not, this concept of multivoting, prevalent in multiple DPoS architectures, has caused the formation of what are known as 'cartels.' They are tight-knit groups of node operators who withhold voting rewards until certain conditions are met. Simply put? 'Vote for all of us or get rewards from none of us.'\n\nIf cartels grow to a certain size, they become very difficult to remove by dissenting voters. This is especially true if a substantial amount of coins in circulation are already 'in use,' voting for the cartel.\n\nEven if there is no active cartel in a network, lazy voters might simply vote for all currently active node operators, creating stagnancy in the list of active operators. This could make the network resistant to new ideas and progression. Active operators become an accidental cartel, and those operators on the sidelines have steeper and steeper hills to climb to get involved in governance.\n\nInterestingly enough, addressing node operator cartels was front and center in the minds of the founders of ARK even back in 2016. To accomplish this, founders implemented a '1 ARK = 1 Vote' approach in the architecture, preventing multivoting.\n\nAs a result, there have been no instances that I could find of ARK Validators banding together on the protocol level to cement their position as a group in the network. There has been no hostage-taking of votes on the ARK Public Network in the same way witnessed on other DPoS networks featuring multivoting.\n\n## Centralization Snafu\n\nWe're not out of the woods yet as we take a hard look at DPoS under the microscope. As the Blockchain and crypto industries progressed and Delegated Proof-of-Stake rose to popularity, an event transpired that forced everyone in the space to call everything into question.\n\nThe story has a lot of twists and turns, so let's view it as a list of the key events:\n\n- At some point during the first quarter of 2020, Tron founder Justin Sun acquired Steemit, Inc, the company behind a popular decentralized publishing platform running on the Steem Blockchain. Steem is a Blockchain running Delegated Proof-of-Stake\n- In the words of the book _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_, 'This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move'\n- Justin Sun had intended to use team funds held by Steemit, Inc to vote for Witnesses. This went directly against Steemit, Inc's promise to the community that they would not use team funds in governance\n- Reacting to this intention, the Steem community of Witnesses froze those funds from voting, acting in the interests of their voters and Steem community members\n- Sun then went to three major exchanges and convinced them to counteract that community move by powering up vote weight using user funds on exchanges, allowing Sun to temporarily take over the network\n- The exchanges then went back on that decision upon learning more details about the actions taking place\n- Through an outpouring of support from the Steem community and beyond, community nodes regained network homeostasis\n- Many community members and Witnesses felt that it was time to break away in a new direction, so they forked the network to create the [Hive Blockchain](https://hive.io) and ecosystem. Hive now grows and develops separately from Steem.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1PJXo7c.png)\n\n> For more details and talking points on this story, listen to my podcast episode ['Reacting to the Steemit Acquisition Story,'](https://ark.io/podcast/reacting-to-the-steemit-acquisition-story-with-ray-alvarez-and-dean-van-dugteren-ark-crypto-podcast-066) featuring ARK.io President Ray Alvarez (then Strategic Partnerships Manager), and Founder of Compendia Dean van Dugteren (Compendia was called NOS at the time).\n\nAn interesting note I make in the podcast episode is that a similar takeover could occur on Proof-of-Work networks, if the entity involved were to acquire large mining farms until they retain majority hashrate. The key difference there is that the coin holders would have no real recourse. As we saw with the Steemit story, Witnesses and holders were able to speak with their collective voice directly through the DPoS protocol to respond and react.\n\n## What Does It All Mean?\n\nDelegated Proof-of-Stake presents itself with a healthy list of advantages:\n\n- Far increased scalability over Proof-of-Work networks\n- Streamlined network upgrades due to less nodes participating in consensus\n- More convenience for end users\n- Orders of magnitude less energy costs compared with Proof-of-Work networks\n- Faster confirmation times\n- Leaner and more responsive wallets, as no full node sync is required\n\nDespite these benefits, node operator incidents, cartel formations, and the Steemit, Inc acquisition and subsequent fallout are stark reminders of what some of the trade-offs are when selecting Delegated Proof-of-Stake as a consensus mechanism.\n\n**Although things can go awry sometimes within a DPoS system, it doesn't mean there isn't a way to do it right and minimize the risks while capitalizing on the benefits simultaneously.**\n\n## How to Spot a Good DPoS Project\n\nHere are a few things that I believe make up a good DPoS project:\n\n> Good DPoS projects have an active community participating in voting and strong voter turnouts. When node operators misbehave, they are quickly removed from consensus. When new operators appear with good ideas, they are quickly voted into consensus.\n\nOver 46% of all ARK in circulation is currently involved in voting. That number increases to over 56% when setting aside ARK business entity funds that don't vote.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2lXJRJK.png)\n\n> The [ARK Explorer](https://explorer.ark.io) provides insights like these, updating in real-time.\n\nRegarding turnover, I recall a case where an ARK Validator made a grave error leading to a potential security issue, and the community quickly detected it and voted the Validator out.\n\nI also remember Validators who came to the ecosystem with great ideas for community services and were voted in same day. ARK has a very active voting community, and the ecosystem is welcoming to new people that want to improve it.\n\n> Good DPoS projects have voting architecture that limits or prevents exploits enabled by game theory.\n\nARK has a '1 ARK = 1 Vote' mechanism and no multivoting. This stunts any future cartels from gaining an unfair advantage. It's actually one of the founding principles of the ARK DPoS consensus mechanism.\n\n> The Foundations/Organizations of good DPoS projects have reasonably-sized coin holdings compared to the overall circulating supply. They actively seek out productive ways to disperse their coins to the community, lowering centralization risk.\n\nCurrently, the [ARK business entity](https://ark.io/about) possesses around 17% of the total circulating supply of ARK coins. The team actually aimed for this number to be even lower, but the ARK business entity inadvertently inherited extra ARK coins after the Token Exchange Campaign in 2016 (fewer coins than expected were exchanged). ARK disburses these funds to the community in various ways, minimizing centralization risk:\n\n- [ARK Development and Security Bounty Program](https://bounty.ark.io)\n- [ARK Grants with 1 Million ARK Seed Funds](https://grants.ark.io)\n- [ARK Contests](https://www.arktimeline.com/?tags=CTST)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Fp4S8Vj.png)\n\n> Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/IbSzpGW2cqU) to learn more about ARK Grants\n\nAmong others, there are additional ways the ARK business entity reduces its ARK holdings:\n\n- Marketing Initiatives funded by ARK coins\n- Salary Supplements for ARK team members\n\nNeedless to say, if any Proof-of-Stake project, delegated or not, launches with too many funds reserved for the team (numbers approaching 50%), that is 'no bueno.' 17% is okay, but it could be even lower if you get involved with the ecosystem and earn ARK in the process!\n\n> Join the [ARK Discord](https://discord.ark.io) to speak directly with the team about our ARK inititiatives.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs Dean van Dugteren points out in the [podcast episode](https://ark.io/podcast/reacting-to-the-steemit-acquisition-story-with-ray-alvarez-and-dean-van-dugteren-ark-crypto-podcast-066), Proof-of-Work is driven by pure math and energy, but DPoS adds a human element which can be a wildcard. With the huge array of various DPoS projects out there, we are fortunate enough to see which DPoS-related ideas are working, and which should be retired.\n\nI continue to support the concept of DPoS because it gives me, a small coin holder, a voice in the network in a way Bitcoin simply can't.

      "body": "In 2021, the team at ARK.io soft-launched [MSQ](https://MSQ.io), the new platform that allows anyone to discover and connect with their next favorite Blockchain project. However, it covers the whole Blockchain and crypto industries, not just the ARK Ecosystem. Now if that's the case, why build it at all? And how is this good for ARK?\n\n## MSQ is in Our DNA\n\nSince its inception in late 2016, ARK has focused on harmonizing the industry so it can put up a united front and tackle the centralized status quo. The original 27 Founders of ARK believed that, so long as tribalism keeps the industry divided, it will be all the more difficult to take on the existing global players.\n\nWhen asked about MSQ, ARK.io Co-Founder, Board Chairman, and Chief Strategy Officer, Matthew DC, had this to say:\n\n> Crypto is a community as a whole, not necessarily just ARK or just Ethereum or just Bitcoin. Too much in this industry, people have focused on 'well, I'm a Bitcoin person and that's it,' or 'I'm an Ethereum person.' Everybody is focused on one technology, but really it's about pushing the industry forward as a whole. The idea behind MSQ was to build something that was for companies, projects, and startups to build community together as an industry\n\nFrom the beginning of ARK, the Founders promoted a culture where good people doing good things in Blockchain are always welcome.\n\n- It's why we are centered around interoperability and quickly got to work on our [SmartBridge technology](https://ark.io/blog/what-is-the-ark-smartbridge-and-how-does-it-work-arkio-blog) to connect different Blockchains together (with successful tests in 2017)\n- It's why ARK Core has so many [programming language SDKs](https://ark.io/developers), so developers can work with ARK regardless of which language is their favorite\n- It's why we developed and released [Platform SDK](https://ark.io/blog/arks-platform-sdk-tying-it-all-together-arkio-blog), a complete solution for developers to integrate the most popular Blockchains into their applications\n- It's why our wallets are turning multi-asset, so users can store their favorite non-ARK based coins on our wallets (under the new name and [upcoming release, Payvo](https://ark.io/blog/say-hello-to-payvo))\n- It's also why our [upcoming release, Nodem](https://ark.io/blog/nodem-first-look-the-ultimate-node-manager), has future feature plans for running nodes on non-ARK networks, too\n\nIn the [ARK Whitepaper](https://ark.io/Whitepaper.pdf), we discussed the implementation of marketplaces where people can browse and discover what they are looking for like cool plugins or reliable node operators. As we continued to make our way through our roadmap, we determined that these marketplaces should really be covering the whole industry, not just the ARK Ecosystem. Doing it that way actually fit our mission statement more closely than doing it only for ARK, because ARK has been all about uniting the industry since day one.\n\nThis ethos has actually been a major driving force for why I got so involved with the ARK project and ecosystem, even before I joined the team. When I first got involved in the space, learning about all the different coins other than Bitcoin, I found a *lot* of tribalism, and in extreme cases, almost a cult mentality. People were quick to clutch onto the coin they are familiar with the most and blindly challenge or reject different ideas. I wasn't gelling with that.\n\nThe ARK community, on the other hand, seemed very welcoming of other cool things going on in the industry. It was interesting to learn that ARK was _hosting_ AMAs for totally separate projects [as far back as 2017](https://arktimeline.com/?tags=AMAX&tdate=01-01-2018). Woah! A Blockchain project that loves to hang out with other Blockchain projects? I can get used to this!\n\nAs I saw MSQ evolve throughout development, I viewed it as something that ARK was actually best suited to execute. MSQ is in our DNA.\n\nBut how does it help ARK?\n\nMy take is that ARK's ethos is actually a breath of fresh air in the space and has been for years. As a result, I believe the ARK community can grow _because_ of it, not _in spite of_ it. This comment on one of our MSQ videos about [Hive](https://hive.io) says it best:\n\n![Comment on a Hive video we made on 3Speak](https://i.imgur.com/VxqyaUh.png)\n\n**People are definitely catching our drift and want to explore ARK deeper because of it.** With MSQ serving as a real-life platform aiming to unite the industry, I see MSQ as a tangible embodiment of ARK's intangible personality.\n\n## Building Relationships Together\n\nThe ARK Ecosystem can benefit as a direct result of forming meaningful, lasting relationships with other players in the industry through MSQ. The recently-appointed President of the ARK business entity, Ray Alvarez, has seen this first-hand.\n\nA stand-out example of how relationships through MSQ have helped ARK increase its reach is [Travala.com](https://MSQ.io/projects/travalacom), the industry's leading crypto-friendly travel booking platform. Even though ARK had already been working on interfacing with Travala's team to accept ARK for their 3 million+ travel and leisure products, the advent of MSQ accelerated the formation of that relationship drastically. After learning of MSQ, Travala went on to become one of the first partners on the platform and started accepting ARK on their platform with an announcement. Today users can use the ARK coin directly to book flights, hotels, and experiences on Travala.\n\nAt the time, Ray's title was not President, but Strategic Partnerships Manager. He was largely responsible for garnering partnerships and relationships for both ARK and MSQ (he still does, albeit a bit more _presidentially_). When asked how MSQ speeds up and improves the partnership process, Ray had this to say:\n\n> MSQ is one of the products we are really focusing on at ARK. The entire platform is built for the entire crypto community, and through our talks with various partners, we've also had the opportunity to work with them on ARK-related initiatives. MSQ provides a great pipeline for partners that are looking to get more involved in our products, whether it's Payvo or Platform SDK\n\nYou could say that projects that join MSQ get automatically 'enrolled' in our outreach efforts for the platform as a whole. We produce content for partners in the form of articles and videos, work to drive traffic to their Profiles, and even feature them in our own media campaigns and strategies. By extending a helping hand to help other projects and entities reach more people, it becomes easier to have conversations about how ARK technology may be able to help them with their own project goals.\n\nAfter all, a well-known mantra in the ARK community since the beginning has been 'ARK has no competitors, only future partners.'\n\n## Cross-Promotion\n\nMSQ is a separate sub-brand and product built by the ARK team, and there's a specific reason it was not named 'ARK Marketplace.' MSQ is both a coin-agnostic and platform-agnostic product, where each project can shine, build community, and collaborate with each other, regardless of whether it is powered by ARK technology or not.\n\nAs the overall awareness and reach of MSQ grows, we can leverage it to educate people about ARK, when the circumstances make sense of course. Will we be blasting our MSQ mailing list (that has thousands of email addresses on it) every day saying 'Hey, go learn about ARK?' No, I don't believe so. But will we send a mass email linking to a great piece of content about the industry that just so happens to feature ARK within it? Sure! Which is what we did when we released MSQ's video [The Blockchains of Ready Player One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PYKp06wlGY) that covers NFTs, gaming, and cool Blockchain projects like [Enjin](https://enjin.io/).\n\nARK also got its own featurette in that video, highlighting its multichain solution to address scalability concerns. Over 10,000 people saw that video, and we even had the chance to work with over two dozen other content creators for sponsored content relating to it during March of this year.\n\nJust as Ray mentioned, with MSQ easing the process of working with partners to do _cool ARK things_, I also experienced the 'MSQ effect' when collaborating with these content creators. It was easier to get into conversations with them surrounding MSQ and our content therein, which in turn resulted in more interest from them about ARK and its goals.\n\n## Crypto & Blockchain Integrations on MSQ\n\nWe are still early in the grand plan, but I'm starting to feel the magnetism in the industry already surrounding everything ARK has been up to this year. Development of MSQ was brought to completion during Q1, and the launch plan kicked off during Q2. We are currently public, but still on an 'invite code' status (which will be lifted when we carry out the main public launch).\n\nThe current public version of MSQ is somewhat of a Minimum Viable Product, and many powerful features are still in the development plan. Some of those features involve cryptocurrency integration into the platform, including the ARK coin. A few examples include paying for advertising, featured content, or bounties using ARK coins. However, our attention for now is to build out the feature set of MSQ such that it becomes the go-to destination for everything Blockchain in the industry. That, coupled with building a large userbase on MSQ, is no simple feat. Luckily, the ARK team enjoys tackling these types of challenges head-on.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile it may seem reasonable to wonder how MSQ helps ARK, taking a closer look reveals what is really going on. We are dead-set on the unification of the industry (as we always have been), we are increasing our reach and reputation as we build meaningful relationships with other projects and entities, and we are building products that can integrate with the ARK Blockchain and coin.\n\nWhile it looks like 4D chess sometimes, it boils down to a recipe that is pretty simple: 'Make friends in the industry, show off their cool stuff, make cool stuff, show everybody our cool stuff.' I believe in that plan, and as we continue to prepare our releases of more MSQ features, Core V3, Explorer, Payvo, Nodem, Deployer, and other ARK goodies, it seems that great things lie in ARK's future.",

Whether its their art, their exciting communities, or the unique things planned in their projects, there is definitely something here to grab your interest. Today we are taking a look at the Robotos \n\n## Domo Arigato Robotos\n[Robotos](https://www.robotos.art/) are a collection of 9,999 cute robot NFTs. The art in the collection reminds me of Cool Cats mixed in with that friendly robot from the Jetsons. The artist behind the collection is [Pablo Stanley](pablostanley). He has worked on a variety of projects and brings is unique artstyle to Robotos. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jlm9Nmr.png)\n\nWhen you get a Roboto you are getting more than just the actual NFT. Each NFT comes with a variety of image files (SVG, PNG, Animated GIF) and rights to create and distribute derivatives. The collection has a total of 170+ traits with varying rarities across different categories. You have common types such as Robotos and more rare types such as Cyborgos and Computos. \n\nWhat is interesting about this project is that they don't take any chances with their license. Lot's of projects have a simple line saying in their website saying \"Each NFT comes with a commercial license but you can't use our logo\" for excample. Yet, Robotos seems to really lay out the legalese. You can see the license [here](https://www.robotos.art/roboto-license.html). \n\nThe license is non-exclusive, meaning that yes you can display your Roboto, you can sell it, you can copy it for the purposes of making derivative works. However, you also face competition from other licensees. The licensor (in this case Pablo Stanley) has the right to grant other individuals or entities a right to use your Roboto. \n\n*Does this compute with current practice in the NFT space? Let me know, tweet at me [@lumberjacklar](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar)*\n\n## What's Next for Robotos\n\nOne of the main things on the Robotos roadmap is the development and backstory for the characters of the collection. The team is also looking to do monthly collaborations with other artists. \n\nThey are also looking to hold member-exclusive workshops and take feedback from the community on how to best implement \"breeding\". Wait a minute...Robots are starting to breed....then it's too late...we've already lost. \n\nI for one, am ready to serve our new robot overlords and like the art in this collection. \n\n\n## Important Numbers Beep Boop Beep\n* Total Items: 10,000\n* Owners: 2.3K\n* Floor Price: .18 ETH\n* Volume Traded: 1.4K ETH\n\nThe collection is currently sold out but can be viewed on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/robotos-official).\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com\n) and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).*\n\nWe will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord](https://MSQ.io/discord) every Tuesday and Friday at 3PM EST.

      "body": "Join us as we take a look at our Discovery of the Day! Whether its their art, their exciting communities, or the unique aspects of their roadmap, there is definitely something here for everyone. \n\nToday we are taking a look at [The WolfGang](https://thewolfgang.club/). \n\n## What is The WolfGang? \n\n[The WolfGang](https://thewolfgang.club/) is a generative NFT project featuring 10,000 highly detailed and stylized Wolves featuring a lot of really interesting traits. From hoodies, to swanky jackets, to Zombie skins, these wolves are some of the best looking designs we have seen as of yet.\n\nThe project launched on July 26th, 2021 and subsequently sold out on August 5th with a lot of action in between. What really sets The WolfGang apart from other projects is their ambitious roadmap and pace of development which really sets the bar high for this project. \n\n## A Roadmap to Eclipse All Others\n\nThe roadmap for The WolgGang features several ambitious projects including donations, companions, breeding, and even a game. While an ambitious roadmap can be concerning for some projects, the fact that The Wolfgang team has already delivered a fully fleshed out series of companions since the launch is a great sign for the future. \n\nLet's take a look at some of the most interesting items from the roadmap. \n\n### The Cutest Companions\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PCdf1h8.png)\n\n[The Wolf Gang Pups](https://opensea.io/collection/the-wolfgang-pups) are by far one of the coolest looking companions to launch in any project. These little pupperonis feature 4,000 randomly generated companion pups with a ton of really great traits.\n\nThe most impressive thing about the companions was the pace at which the team delivered. While some projects (looking at you Elephants) have been working on their companions for weeks if not longer, The WolfGang Pups were launched before the project even completed their sellout. \n\nThat says a lot about the dedication and focus of the team as well as their technical capabilities to deliver on the rest of the roadmap. \n\nIn order to get a pup you will need to have minted a Wolf numbered between 1-4000 and pups can be claimed at the official [WolfGang website](https://thewolfgang.club/). \n\n### Breed Your Perfect Wolf\n\nThis may be the feature that is the most exciting aspect of The WolfGang. Breeding will be a major feature and very different from anything else on the market. While other projects have approached breeding with some succes, Axie and CryptoKitties in particular, The Wolfgang is taking a much different approach. \n\nThe WolfGang breeding process will allow holders to merge 2 Wolves that they own and ***select their favorite traits from each***. That's right, custom bred Wolves! Instead of breeding your wolves and getting a random generative wolf in return, you can now pick and choose which traits from the parents you want to keep and make the wolf that is perfect for you! \n\nThis is an entirely new approach to breeding and should bring a lot of excitement to the secondary market as certain traits become more or less in demand for breeding. \n\nIt does come with a few caveats though. \n\n- You must own 2 wolves to breed. \n- You can only select traits from one of the 2 parent Wolves\n- The parents are burned in the process\n- Bred wolves cannot be bred a 2nd time\n\nThis breeding system will add an entirely new aspect to a project that is already a lot of fun. It's both exciting and also uncharted territory. It will be very interesting to see how this plays out and if other projects follow suit. Suffice it to say, we have a close eye on this one! \n\n### Plus Donation, Giveaways, and a Game! \n\nWe told you the roadmap was ambitious and we weren't kidding! Along with the main project, the companions, and breeding, they also have made several donations with more planned, have given away hundreds of NFTs including a Bored Ape, and still have an entire PVE/PVP game yet to build. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/I80JU37.png)\n\nAlso worth noting is that the project has seen [support from Trey Songz](https://twitter.com/TreySongz/status/1423064940500324355?s=20) and Floyd Mayweather who both hold wolves. \n\nAll of this points to a project that has a lot of room to grow and a really exciting future. Bottom line, the team has proven to be capable and has a roadmap I think a lot of communities would be envious of. \n\n## Exclusive Interview\n\n![](youtube:OtlzUoPEzg4)\n\nWe had the pleasure of conducting an exclusive interview with the Project Lead for The WolfGang. Find out more about the story behind the project, what motivates them, and the crazy feat they managed to pull off launching The Wolfgang and doing all of the art in just 48 hours! \n\n## The WolfGang By the Numbers\n\nLet's take a quick look at some WolfGang stats: \n\n- 10,000 Stylized Wolf NFTs\n- Mint Price: 0.03 ETH\n- Current Floor: 0.05 ETH\n- Total Volume: 129 ETH\n- Over 300 Traits Available\n- Project Launched: July 26th, 2021\n- Sold Out: August 5th, 2021\n\n***\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com\n) and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).*\n\nWe will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord](https://MSQ.io/discord) every Tuesday and Friday at 3PM EST.

      "body": "The NFTYVerse never sleeps, but you have to! Let's take a look back on all of the action from the past weekend so you can be ready for the week ahead! \n\n## Celebrities Ape In to NFTs\n\nThe NFT market has been fire for months now and people are starting to take notice as the appeal of Social Media Profile Pictures (PFPs) continue to be one of the hottest items. Leading the charge this weekend were some high profile celebrities who started aping in to several new NFT launches. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vcRzXwd.png)\n\nLet's be clear, celebrities in NFTs aren't a new thing. Many high profile celebrities such as Paris Hilton, Snoop Dogg, Lindsay Lohan, Steve Aoki, Rob Gronkowski, Tony Hawk and even Eminem have [launched custom NFTs](https://decrypt.co/63694/biggest-celebrities-who-launched-nfts-snoop-dogg-lohan-hirst-grimes) to huge success in the past. Not to mention the Stoner Cats project featuring multiple celbrities like Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis, Chris Rock, and Seth MacFarlane. \n\n*So what makes this time different? Why might the activity this weekend be a turning point?*\n\nWell, this weekend we saw some interesting activity. Celebrities were tweeting about NFTs but not because they were launching their own collections. Instead, this weekend we saw [Trey Songz](https://twitter.com/TreySongz/status/1423064940500324355?s=20), [Floyd Mayweather](https://twitter.com/TheWolfGangNFT/status/1423769541084069893?s=20), [Soulja Boy](https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1423782642059644930?s=20), and even [Ja Rule](https://twitter.com/jarule/status/1424111423714729994?s=20) tweeting about and buying PFPs from existing collections. In the case of Ja Rule, he even tagged some of his friends which will only spread the word. This shows a new level of interest in not just cashing in on the hype, but ***being a part of the movement***. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gBAULZS.png)\n\nFor me, this is a major shift in sentiment. Celebrities  using industry PFPs launched by other artists as their actual profile pictures can bring huge awareness to the market. It's not spurred on by profits, but by actual interest in the art and movement itself. \n\nOnly time will tell if they will stick with their newfound NFTs or if some of this is just a marketing ploy for future launches we haven't yet heard about. Either way, they are bringing mainstream attention to NFTs and we definitely aren't complaining! \n\n## EIP1559 & Gas Fees\n\nOur first weekend post-london fork is in the books and we have learned a lot. Most importantly? EIP1559 hasn't made much of a different for the NFT market. \n\nI've seen a lot people in various discord channels discussing EIP1559 and it seems like there is a lot of misinformation or misunderstanding of what it is and what it is meant to do. \n\n> EIP1559 is NOT meant to lower gas fees directly. \n\nWhat EIP1559 is meant to do is curb some of the volatility and level out gas fees to make them more consistent and predictable. Unfortunately, we saw this weekend with several major NFT launches that fees can and will still skyrocket, hitting upwards of $200 at one point to mint during the CryptoZunks launch. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/T7wXVEE.png)\n\nWhile EIP1559 is a good first step, ETH 2.0 is necessary to actually fix the fees problem. To learn more about EIP1559 and what it actually does, check out [this article by Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/ethereum-improvement-proposal-ETH-gas-fee) which breaks it down quite well. \n\n## 🔥 Joe's Hot Takes 🔥\n\n- MSQ has [launched an invite competition](https://twitter.com/HelloMSQ/status/1424393030082105350?s=20).

      "body": "NFT Launches are hit or miss. When they hit, they really hit, but with that comes a lot of potential for disaster. We have seen countless sell-outs that brought with them horrible gas fees, smart contract issues, website issues, delayed reveals, and even rug pulls. \n\nUnfortunately for Space Poggers, one of the most highly anticipated launches of the week, they got the royal flush. Let's take a look at what happened. \n\n## Delays\n\nWhen a project starts off launch day with a delay, it's never a good sign. For Space Poggers fans, the bad news came early with the announcement of a weeks delay in revealing the art due to an issue that required the team to re-upload all of the art for the collection to IPFS. \n\nIn fairness to the team, they took to twitter to be transparent and explain what happened to those who were waiting to mint and decided not to delay the minting despite the setback. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UczP7ZE.png)\n\nJust kidding, later in the day they announce a 2 hour delay in minting, which while not bad, is still a delay and for those in different timezones, would have seen them [staying up until 4 AM](https://twitter.com/GetUnorthofox/status/1424474887540789251?s=20) to try and get a chance to mint a pogger. \n\nBut OK, sure, while that isn't the best news, it's only 2 hours and then everything will be fine and everyone will have their new found furry friends and all will be right with the world. \n\n## Ethereum Gas Prices are the Devil\n\nWith the launch of CryptoZunks on Saturday, we saw gas prices skyrocket to over $200. Suffice it to say, Space Poggers was not immune to the stupidity that is current Ethereum gas fees. \n\nAs typical with major launches, gas fees went through the roof with at least one user paying as much as [$2400 in FEES alone to mint their Poggers](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcb73d5f42349738072a29dd55f3b8cca16d0e10bbcc9040d4a10b9ec1b8af06f). On a positive note, due to EIP1559, the Space Poggers drop managed to burn over 569 Ethereum in gas fees leaving some Ethereum supporters pretty excited. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RACM0um.png)\n\nWith no end in sight until ETH 2.0 launches, this won't be the last time we see high gas fees in an NFT drop and it has become business as usual for serious collectors. For smaller colelctors however, it doesn't make the reality sting any less with many being priced out of new drops on gas fees alone. \n\n## Tip of the Iceberg\n\nIf that wasn't enough, hold on to your BAYC hats because it got worse. Shortly after launch, users started noticing something was wrong with the minting process. Users who were purchasing 50 Poggers were only actually getting 10. \n\nAgain, to their credit, the team quickly addressed the issues on twitter and announced that they would be [paying back a whopping $1.5 million](https://twitter.com/SpacePoggersNFT/status/1424475619576848384?s=20) to members who lost Eth due to frontend issues with their website. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4pA6IQm.png)\n\nNone of this is a good look for the project but many stuck with it, had success minting, and the project still sold out in about 20 minutes flat. Despite the issues, the factors that made Space Poggers so exciting in the first place still exist. The project features great artwork, an ambitious roadmap, and a team that despite a few setbacks, has been fully transparent and worked diligently to fix the problems. \n\nDo they deserve a second chance to make it right? I believe so. This industry is still new and there are going to be hiccups along the way. The team appears to be genuine and has worked hard to make up for their mistakes and fix the issues. Only time will tell if that is enough for collectors to give them a second chance, but if I had to guess, based on current market conditions, I would bet that they will. \n\n---\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com) and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).*\n\nDon’t forget to join us every ***Tuesday and Friday at 3PM EST*** in the MSQ Discord #NFT Channel ***for NFT Giveaways***!

      "name": "Why Vitalik is Wrong About DeFi",
      "slug": "why-vitalik-is-wrong-about-defi",
      "body": "***Vitalik Buterin ([Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) & [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/)) took the stage at [EthCC 4](https://ethcc.io/) in Paris recently to declare that it’s time to move beyond DeFi and 'just making tokens that help with trading other tokens.'***\n\n![](youtube:oLsb7clrXMQ)\n\nHe went on to explain that the goal of Ethereum had always been to push decentralization beyond the financial sector, which—he argues—is broken and cites as the reason for DeFi’s popularity.\n\nButerin continued to describe why hype and censorship is bad, jokingly calls for canceling Kim Kardashian, and explores other areas where crypto technology can meet or exceed existing technologies badly in need of replacement.\n\n## Social Media\n\n---\n\nThe centralization and censorship inherent in current-day Social Media—for instance—makes it ripe for replacement by protocols that offer credible neutrality, shared open states, and economic layers that incentivize higher quality content.\n\nHe also listed several examples of crypto-social media platforms such as [Steem](https://steem.com/) and [Hive](https://hive.io/eco) that already exist. While he didn’t mention [MSQ](https://MSQ.io/) by name, we’re pretty sure it was on his mind… I’m prepared to forgive him for a simple oversight.\n\n## Funding Public Goods\n\n---\n\nAmong other issues, Vitalik also spoke at great lengths about a concept known as Retroactive Public Goods Funding. In short, the funding of public goods is something that private businesses and governments often fail at, and this also applies to protocol development.\n\nHe offers the example of [EIP-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md), which sat relatively untouched for some time after its initial introduction. Without adequate funding, there was little motivation to work on development despite the arguably beneficial impact it could have on the Ethereum Ecosystem.\n\nInterest around EIP-1559 only began building **after** there was already funding, leading to the question, “How does important infrastructure gain funding and public interest when doing so requires funding and public interest?”\n\nHe proposes that it’s much easier to agree something *was* useful than it is to agree that something *will be* useful. As such, a viable solution could be the concept of a DAO that retroactively rewards projects recognized for providing value, the general idea being that more projects would be willing to take risks if there were a greater likelihood of being rewarded for success.\n\n## Vitalik is Right\n\n---\n\nThis makes a lot of sense too. Imagine arguing the importance of the telegram to carrier pigeons. First, the pigeons would have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about...because they’re pigeons. Secondly, it would be impossible to gain interest from the general pigeon community at large because even the telegram has no concept of what doors will be opened down the road...and again, pigeons.\n\nArguably, without the invention of the telegram, we would not have the internet. Love it or loathe it, the internet allows ideas and people to connect instantly, learn nearly anything they choose, and gives underserved communities access to important resources.\n\nSo then how do we convince the pigeons to invest in the telegram? Easy, let the pigeons reward the telegram after they realize it benefits them; no more cages; no more couriering messages strapped to their legs. They’re now free to just be birds.\n\n## Vitalik is Wrong?\n\n---\n\nOverall, he’s correct. The existing infrastructures of the 21st century need to be replaced with something that works for the 21st century and beyond...but does that mean moving *beyond* DeFi? **No.**\n\nWhat he essentially argues is that it’s time to look past decentralized finance and on to...decentralized financing.\n\nTo be fair, Vitalik states he’s not actually against DeFi and believes the best solution is to combine the worlds of finance and non-finance. I would add then, that DeFi is a necessary component of Ethereum’s vision of decentralization. DeFi isn’t only a means to our end, but a part of the underlying infrastructure of our destination, not *just* something to be moved beyond.\n\n...or is this exactly what Vitalik was saying all along, and was “moving beyond DeFi” just a troll on all of us to get our attention? 🤔\n\nIf so, well-played, Mr Buterin...Well-played.\n\n![](https://media1.giphy.com/media/NJZMSqRY3rG9i/giphy.gif?cid=5e2148861t51p9fkmz6kx76k7j92f8a4u7bxy66j07gd0os9&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)",

      "slug": "the-bittersweet-relationship-of-gaming-and-nfts",
      "body": "***In recent decades, gaming has moved from crowding in front of a TV in your friend's basement to sold-out stadiums with teams competing for global prestige and huge paydays. Even though Blockchain and gaming should be a perfect pairing, with new ideas come new challenges...***\n\n## Real Ownership in a Digital World\n\nGames like *Counter-Strike*, *League of Legends*, and *Valorant* lead the way for professional gamers and streamers, but decentralized games built on Blockchain technology are introducing new concepts and ideas into the gaming industry. You can truly own your items in a game through NFTs, and even mine or earn real cryptocurrency in-game. Imagine that flaming Recon helmet in Halo or the castle you built in MineCraft actually holding real world value.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VFjIOra.png)\n\n> Back in my day, this was Peak Flex.\n\nThe best part? You have full control over exactly what to do with them. Wanna sell that item and pay your rent this month? Do it! Wanna charge for tours of your castle? Do it! Digital ownership in games through Blockchain is revolutionizing the entire idea of what the gaming industry is and could become.\n\n## NFTs and Gaming: Friends from the Start\n\nNFTs were first introduced when Kevin McCoy created 'Quantum' in 2014, and it didn't take long after that for the first NFT-based game to show up. In 2015, Etheria launched on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Network only 3 months after its creation. Etherea was a Civilization-style game that first introduced the concept of being a digital real estate owner.\n\nDid it have good graphics? No. Was it popular? Hard to say considering the Blockchain community itself was much smaller back then. Nevertheless, did it create a concept that would eventually grow digital land ownership from $1 USD at the outset to [$130,781 USD](https://decrypt.co/61359/an-nft-game-almost-old-as-ethereum-just-resurfaced-and-players-are-cashing-out) more recently? Yep, it sure did!\n\n## Non-Fungible Felines\n\nThat growth took time though: it wasn't until December 2017 that NFT gaming truly arrived, with a surge in popularity for the collectibles-breeding game [CryptoKitties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoKitties#:~:text=As%20of%20December%202%2C%202017,can%20be%20passed%20to%20offspring). In it, users trade and breed NFT kittens, and the value of these NFTs is determined through voting within the general community. The first NFT to sell for a high price was the kitty named 'Genesis,' selling for the unbelievable sum of $117,712 USD!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BALOvPS.png)\n\n> This dainty digital kitty named Genesis costs 'just a scootch more' than the free cats my friend adopted from behind a dumpster. If a 'scootch' is defined as about 117 thousand dollars, that is...\n\nSimilar to horse breeding in real life, 'Genesis' could breed new NFTs that commanded a much higher value in general. And with that sale, it cemented a new question that will determine the future of the Blockchain NFT gaming industry:\n\n_Is NFT-based gaming really made to attract more gamers or just more investors?_\n\n## Things That Make You Go Hmmm...\n\nThere is no denying that NFT-based games are growing in popularity when you consider the current [prices of in-game NFTs](https://gamerant.com/video-game-nft-selling-prices/). A card from the game [God's Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/) sold for $60,000 and a user even paid $1.5 million USD for 9 plots of land in the game [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/). But who are these people paying huge sums of money? Are they gamers or investors?\n\nNonfungible.com released a [report](https://nonfungible.com/blog/blockchain-gaming-player-distribution-s12019) in 2019 that attempted to provide some analytics on the NFT gaming community. They generated various statistics from 14 popular Blockchain games.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CXn0ZxK.png)\n\n> This website is focused on analyzing and tracking NFTs.\n\nThe 2019 report estimated that the entire player base of NFT games numbered around 50,000. Furthermore, they found players made up slightly more of the community than traders, but not by much. However, with a community so closely divided lies one of the biggest issues. Investors cause NFT prices to rise, and that alone isn't bad. The issue is that they appear to have no interest in playing the actual game.\n\nHigh prices can hurt the potential growth of the player base who might want to try the game out but are turned off by those prices.\n\nHigh prices could also simultaneously attract more people to the game wanting to get in on that hot NFT price action, but those motivations lean more towards investors than players. Many games built on Blockchain have unfortunately started to show signs of 'Pay-to-Win' models that most of the traditional gaming community adamantly do not support.\n\n## Who's Doing It Right?\n\nLuckily, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Some Blockchain games have included NFT aspects that do not have any Pay-to-Win aspects. It should prove refreshing to see communities, gamers, and speculators growing together without the possibility of losing new potential players who might be turned away by inflated NFT prices.\n\n[Blankos Block Party](https://blankos.com), for example, uses NFTs only for cosmetic purposes. Traders still populate the community and contribute to NFT trading activity, but it doesn't affect the actual gameplay. From where I'm sitting, the real value for gamers lies in these types of Blockchain game models, since they don't promote Pay-to-Win or alienate gamers.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rekCvFM.jpg)\n\n> Blankos Block Party has in-game features that utilize cosmetic NFTs.\n\nIt's hard not to see the power of utilizing Blockchain and NFTs for gaming, and while some games seem to be more tailored to building an NFT investing community, they aren't the only option. That gives veteran gamers like me hope that the future of Blockchain gaming and digital ownership will continue to grow and find some kind of balance.",

      "name": "VeeFriends Holders Hit the NFT Motherlode",
      "slug": "veefriends-holders-hit-the-nft-motherlode",
      "body": "The NFT industry has quietly settled on a handful of projects that form the bedrock of the marketplace. Names like [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), [Ghxsts](https://twitter.com/ghxsts), [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/), and [Art Blocks](https://artblocks.io/) have become well known for their huge sales and massive hype, but there is one collection that has straddled the boundary to that top tier and kept some collectors on the fence. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PSf2ha1.jpg)\n\n\nLaunched by mega marketer [Gary Vee](https://twitter.com/garyvee), [VeeFriends](https://www.veefriends.com/) is a well established but somewhat confusing collection. Launching to major sales figures and a quick sell-out, VeeFriends was one of the first NFT collections to try an ambitious business model that included providing not just NFT's, but access. Access to special conferences, access to physical merch, and even direct access to Gary Vee himself. \n\nThis model proved a huge success and the collection has shown consistent volume in the top tier, but the audience seems to be limited to those who already follow Gary and his vast empire. The question on many minds was whether or not VeeFriends and it's niche business model were limiting it's appeal to the wider market. \n\nFortunately for VeeFriends holders, they have a secret weapon. They know that the main benefit of owning a VeeFriend is that you don't just get an NFT, you get Gary Vee himself and Gary always delivers. \n\n## The Gary Vee Effect\n\n![](youtube:_GmzTgUGPU4)\n\nIf you don't know much about Gary Vee, haven't read his multiple [bestselling books](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/books/), or don't subscribe to his insanely [popular youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/garyvaynerchuk), you may not realize the value of having Gary in your corner.\n\nGary has an amazing rolodex of connections and a unique ability to build value around his brands. On Friday, he used this to his advantage to make a huge announcement that may have just changed the game for VeeFriends holders. \n\nAppearing in a 1-on-1 interview with [Jimmy McNelis, aka J1mmy.eth](https://twitter.com/j1mmyeth), Founder and CEO of NFT42 and general NFT legend, J1mmy announced a new collaboration between VeeFriends and AvaStars that would see 1700 AvaStars airdropped to VeeFriends holders in an unprecedented move. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eNTEHyb.png)\n\nAlong with this announcement, the VeeFriends team and Gary Vee announce an entire program based around this concept called The [VeeFriends Pre-Launch Program (PLP)](https://blog.veefriends.com/2021/08/06/welcome-to-the-veefriends-pre-launch-program-plp/) which is where things really start to get interesting. \n\n## The VeeFriends Pre-Launch Program (PLP)\n\nThe VeeFriends PLP is a program designed to help bring exposure to new proejcts launching custom NFTs while rewarding long term VeeFriends holders. Unlike anything else currently in the industry, it sets up a funnel for constant airdrops to VeeFriends holders bringing massive value along with ownership. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/D5USW25.jpg)\n\nThe program is fairly straightforward. New projects who are launching soon can [fill out a form to apply](https://blog.veefriends.com/2021/08/06/welcome-to-the-veefriends-pre-launch-program-plp/) to be reviewed by the VeeFriends team. If approved, they will set aside 555 NFTs from their upcoming launch to be randomly airdropped to VeeFriends holders. In exchange they get massive exposure to a huge crowd of not just NFT enthusiasts, but because these are Gary Vee followers, marketing minded NFT enthusiasts in particular. \n\nThe value that this relationship can bring to a new project should not be understated. It can provide a massive launching point for both exposure and hype leading into a new launch. What Gary has done with this announcement is bring more hype to VeeFriends, bring value with the AvaStars airdrop, and bring a lot of long term upside through the PLP. \n\n***Like I said before. Gary Vee always delivers and this time, he delivered big.***\n\n--- \n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com) and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).*\n\nDon’t forget to join us every ***Tuesday and Friday at 3PM EST*** in the MSQ Discord #NFT Channel ***for NFT Giveaways***!

Trading traditional markets is already tricky, but in crypto, where volatility is particularly high, margin trading is best left to the pros. However, this hasn't stopped some young people from biting off more than they can chew. Let's take a deeper dive into margin trading in the cryptosphere...***\n\n## Go Big or Go Broke\n\nCrypto is kinda like the Wild West with plenty of rootin' tootin' young bucks bettin' their net worth to reel in some major winnings. Of course some desperados are a little too headstrong and end up gettin' burnt when they raise the stakes just a little *too* high.\n\nIn all seriousness, crypto newbies often end up jumping in with both feet before they really understand what they've gotten themselves into. When it comes to regulation, crypto has enjoyed a pretty decent amount of freedom in recent years, but with more people joining the ranks of the crypto-converted, governments and institutions are beginning to give regulation of the industry much more serious consideration.\n\nNaturally when people hear the 'R' word in crypto, the general response is to panic sell in fears that the entire market is going to plunge headfirst into the abyss. Of course crypto has seen several 'crashes' in the last few years, but in a highly speculative market, what can you expect?\n\nThe idea of regulation shouldn't be treated lightly, but to think of it all as negative is a little short-sighted. While I'm sure there are many who would disagree, regulation does serve a purpose with regards to protecting consumers and preventing them from making potentially dangerous, life-altering decisions. Yeah I get it, we all love the idea of 'freedom,' but let's be real: it's kind of a ridiculous notion, at least in its 'truest' form.\n\nThere are limits to everything, and for good reason. While many are able to exercise discretion and restraint, others who have an appetite for risk often put themselves (and sometimes others) in great peril as a result of their irresponsible or reckless behavior. While regulation may suck the thrill out of markets, it does actually prevent irreversible damage from taking place. And then there's also the fact that it holds intermediaries and exchanges to account when things go wrong.\n\n## FTX Takes the Safe Route\n\nOn July 25th 2021, [FTX](https://ftx.com/)'s CEO, [Sam Bankman-Fried](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-bankman-fried-8367a346/), announced that he would be limiting the amount of margin trading debt permitted on the platform, effectively reducing the 100 times leverage to 20 times.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NLwrg3z.png)\n\nNow there are several reasons for this. Firstly, governments are currently putting many crypto-related exchanges and businesses under the microscope. Unless you are new to the space (or have been living under a rock), [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) has been facing a wave of intense scrutiny from numerous governments around the world with Malaysia being the most recent to join in on the crackdown. In addition, [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/) has been limited from selling its BlockFi Interest Accounts (BIAs) in 4 states in the US.\n\n> I recently covered the BlockFi issue in greater detail. Click [here](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/putting-a-block-on-blockfi) to get the scoop.\n\nAnd those are just two examples, and this is likely just the start. Don't starting quaking in your boots quite yet pilgrim: this ain't the first time crypto has been under fire, and it won't be the last neither! Trust me! Anyway, the point is...FTX are trying to dodge the regulatory bullets already hurtling headlong towards other platforms (see what I did there?) And it's a smart move too if you ask me. If you see your friends taking heat for something you're also doing, you know you're next in line, so it's best to sidestep the hit as best you can while you still can.\n\nNow there seems to be this, shall we say, 'perception' that there are many traders maxing out their leverage and driving the volatility of the crypto market. Well, our pal Sam disagrees, at least in the case of FTX...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sNF3O13.png)\n\nAnd according to the FTX CEO, the number of traders using leverage over 20 times is 'way less than 1%.' Now you might say, 'So what's the big deal?' As it turns out, it is a big deal since many traders using over 20 times leverage are not actually playing with small amounts. For example, a trade that makes use of $2,000 trading capital could lead to massive earnings, but it could also lead to losses of up to $200,000 on 100 times leverage.\n\nThe point is that leverage amplifies profits, but it also amplifies *losses*. And while there are definitely some amazing success stories with people making hundreds of thousand or even millions of Dollars in a single trade, there's another side to this that probably doesn't receive nearly enough attention: the poor souls who lose big time.\n\n## The Tragedy of Alex Kearns\n\nA [CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/18/young-trader-dies-by-suicide-after-thinking-he-racked-up-big-losses-on-robinhood.html) published on June 15th tells the sad story of a young trader by the name of Alex Kearns who tragically ended his life after he believed he had incurred a loss of $730,165 trading options on [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/us/en/). The worst part of this particular story is that he misinterpreted the message he received from the trading platform and did not, in fact, owe nearly three-quarters of a million Dollars.\n\nMoreover, another article from [CNN Business](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/11/investing/robinhood-lawsuit-suicide-alex-kearns/index.html) by Matt Egan explains how Kearns allegedly attempted to contact Robinhood numerous times to get help but failed to receive the assistance and reassurance he desperately needed. Had he been able to get in touch with customer service, it's almost certain he would still be alive today.\n\nThe truth is that Alex didn't have the qualifications, the income or the capital to enter into such a trade, yet he was still allowed to do so. His family blame Robinhood and are suing the platform for Alex's death, and in my opinion, they're entirely justified. Robinhood's negligence and failure to educate their traders led to the suicide of a young and inexperienced man who simply didn't understand the consequences of his actions.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jm08b90.png)\n\nKearns' story is not the only one when it comes to options and margin trading, both in crypto and traditional markets. A [Yahoo! Finance article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-bitcoin-trader-commits-suicide-121816354.html) by Mark Emem from June 2019 explains how a Chinese Bitcoin trader, Hui Yi, sadly committed suicide after losing a staggering 2,000 BTC after entering a short position using 100 times leverage. While there is some controversy over this story, it's clear from both Alex and Hui's story that using extremely high leverage has the potential to ruin lives.\n\n## Crypto with a Conscience?\n\nFrom the above it's probably a lot clearer to you why FTX has reduced its leverage so drastically. People learn by making mistakes, but the truly wise learn from the mistakes of others. Considering what little benefit (if any at all) such high leverage trading brings to FTX, it makes perfect sense for the platform to reduce their own exposure to risk and circumvent similar tragedies that may occur in the future.\n\nIn many ways high leverage trading is a proverbial Sword of Damocles hanging precariously over the heads of many traditional and crypto exchanges. Even professional traders who watch charts and trends every day make mistakes and lose money. The difference is they know how to mitigate and balance their losses. They also typically know when high leverage is a bad idea, and in most cases, it's probably more often than not.\n\nWhile it's possible that FTX's move involves some measure of conscience, it's a deliberate attempt to avoid coming under heavy fire when crypto regulation gets put into effect. As a [Coindesk article](https://www.coindesk.com/ftx-cuts-leverage-limit-to-20x-from-100x-as-criticism-of-margin-trading-in-crypto-grows) by Kevin Reynolds points out, critics of crypto have underscored the high levels of leverage allowed on crypto platforms as one of their main pain points. By self-policing and falling in-line with imminent regulation beforehand, FTX is effectively showing good faith and demonstrating their commitment to following the framework that will soon be outlined and instituted for the industry.\n\n## Finding Answers to the Tough Questions\n\nYou may be asking what you can do to avoid risks and protect yourself from unnecessary issues and possible financial ruination. Thankfully there are answers, so here are a few pointers for you to consider:\n\n- You can always choose to trade Spot instead of Margin, especially if you plan to hold a cryptoasset for the long-term\n- Do your due diligence before attempting to get involved with any financial instrument, crypto or otherwise\n- *Never* jump to conclusions and get total clarity before getting emotional and irrational\n- If for whatever reason you do end up in a difficult situation (please don't!), seek legal advice and other avenues to address the issue at hand\n- You can stake your crypto to earn interest and a reliable passive income that is comparatively safe and sustainable (make sure you do your research first!)\n- Investing in a solid crypto project with real-world applications is arguably a safer (albeit less immediately rewarding) way of making substantial gains\n\nRemember, the above is not financial advice, it's merely some food for thought, especially if you're new to crypto and don't really understand a lot about this rapidly evolving space. Margin trading takes know-how and experience, and even then, traders can still burnt. Never risk more than you can afford to lose, and remember...*do the math!*\n\n## And What About DeFi?\n\nOf course FTX is a Centralized Exchange (CEX), and like other centralized crypto exchanges, it's inevitably going to draw scrutiny from regulating authorities. Now if you think trading crypto on CEXes is like the Wild West, then DeFi should probably make that experience look like a trip to Disney World!\n\nLook, I know I'm being facetious, but, as I mentioned in my previous article, DeFi is pretty complex. Having said that, it's undergoing a lot of development right now. Moreover, it's *really* not very easy to regulate. The question is, 'What is there to regulate?' DeFi platforms use smart contracts and computer code, and the participants trade directly with one another with no intermediaries. While accessibility remains a problem for many traders, there are several platforms working tirelessly to resolve these problems and make DeFi more available to newcomers.\n\nThe coming wave of regulation will likely accelerate DeFi adoption and bring about an entirely new wave of innovation in the cryptosphere. This isn't to say that DeFi *can't* be regulated, but given the way it works, it won't be a simple task. Naturally DeFi is not a simple answer to Centralized Exchanges, and it has its own attendant risks, but given how crypto espouses and enshrines the concept of decentralization, DeFi is probably one of the main vehicles through which actual decentralization will be realized.\n\n> You can find out more about the complexities of margin trading via this [Investopedia article](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp)",

      "body": "***Blockchain games seem to be a hard sell right now. Are they built for investors, gamers, or catering to both? But, one game type has translated into Blockchain more perfectly than anything else: Collectible Card Games. And while there are several to choose from, one seems to be leading the pack...Splinterlands!***\n\n## Discovering the Magic of Card Games\n\nGrowing up in the 90s, I was part of the boom in Collectible Card Games (or CCG). Recess was filled with people looking to trade, improve, and battle with games like *Pokemon*, *Digimon*, and *Yu-Gi-Oh!* But nothing came close to the grand daddy of the playground, *Magic: The Gathering*. \n\n![](https://www.obilisk.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DFE8EE86-45EC-497A-9FDF-CA5CF05337FB-888x500.jpeg)\n\n> This was THE game, and I wanted in!\n\nA friend gave me a practice deck, and after I understood the rules, I. Was. Hooked! I remember the thrill of opening new packs and the indescribable excitement of getting that rare you needed to bring your collection or deck together. I loved everything about the game: the pressure of playing someone skilled, the shift of social allegiances with the draw of just one card, the fun of building decks and developing the next strategy to beat anything that was thrown at me...Then losing, REBUILDING decks and rethinking strategies.\n\nI eventually got so good the competition became, well, to put it lightly? Nonexistent. I started to look for new opponents and discovered local tournaments. Eventually graduating to conventions, I realized, not only was I great in the local community, I...was only great in the local community. If I'm being honest, I got stomped every single time I paid the $50 USD entrance fee to compete at those conventions (U-Con at the University of Michigan, to be exact).\n\n## I Got 99 Problems and Being a Player/Collector IS 1...\n\nOne year while attending U-Con, a friend came with me and decided to sell one of his ultra-rare cards he didn't use to pay for more packs of the newest expansion. It had never occurred to me to do anything like that before. I always noticed the vendors, and drooled over the cards they were selling, but never once did I think of selling cards to buy new packs. It wasn't that the concept of trading was new to me: I had done it many times, with friends and strangers at tournaments, but actually *selling* them? I decided to sell my super rare *Juzam Djinn*, and buy a whole box of packs. After all, he was worth around $400 USD at the time.\n\n![](https://product-images.tcgplayer.com/fit-in/400x558/3211.jpg)\n\n> This bad boy was amazing and valuable, and I was willing to let him go. Money, here I come!\n\nUnfortunately, when I tried, I was presented with the bitter truth of being both an avid player and collector. I USED these cards to play with, and by doing so, their value had reduced considerably. I was told 'You can either be a collector, and retain the value of cards, or you can be a player, and lose that value.' Now, I know what you're thinking: just put them in sleeves. But up until that point, I had no reason or knowledge to do so. I was 10. Obviously I started doing that, but it was too late for some of my high value cards. And what's a player to do? The rarest cards were often the strongest, and if you used those cards, they dropped in value. I tried to use cheap cards written with the good cards' names that I wanted to protect, but that was not allowed in tournaments. You HAD to play those cards. There just didn't seem to be any real way to collect cards and compete in tournaments.\n\n## The Magic of Blockchain\n\nFast forward to 2021, and after all this time, you can finally be a player AND a collector, and get the best of both worlds. How is this possible? With the introduction of NFT-based Blockchain games of course! Inspired by a similar childhood fascination with *Magic: The Gathering*, Matthew Rosen decided to create a digital card gaming experience using NFTs on Blockchain, and thus [Splinterlands](https://splinterlands.com/) was born.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tKe4PzP.jpg)\n\nBuilt on the [Hive Blockchain](https://hive.io/), Splinterlands offers everything *Magic: The Gathering* does and more. It is the premiere Blockchain-based CCG, and for good reason too. Splinterlands lets you buy packs, emulating the same thrilling experience I had with *Magic*. With easy-to-use systems for purchasing provided by [Splinterlands Shop](https://splinterlands.com/?p=shop&tab=), you simply click on the shop button, fill out the necessary information, and? Boom: Your opening packs! One of the most appealing factors is that your cards can be used in games and will never drop in value, an absolutely massive change from my experience with *Magic*. Harnessing the power of NFTs in gaming, Splinterlands makes each card just as unique as a standard Collectible Card Game. Rares are rares, commons are common, and all the while remain in mint condition for resale value.\n\n![](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-MTqLt1UcMaV6ezLJUdy%2F-MXsYVy0NOOCjVhJJYjQ%2F-MXw7b4YRzGriFmx0vE6%2FScreenshot%202021-04-10%20091321.png?alt=media&token=cc8947bd-0fd5-43b0-9815-3a3d8ab14232)\n\n> Doesn't matter how much I use this card, it's still mint. I like it!\n\n## Blockchain for the Win!\n\nBlockchain answers the call concerning all aspects of CCGs. No longer are player pools small and localized. You can get more than the entire U-Con experience just sitting in front of your computer by competing with players from all around the world anytime you want. Want to safely trade or swap cards with other players like the old days? NFTs use smart contracts to make it even safer than physical trades. Want to gain the respect of the community? Win and you can! Splinterlands and Blockchain have all the bases covered for bringing the CCG model into the digital age. Blockchain has an Ace up its sleeve to improve CCGs in a way that would be impossible in the real world.\n\n## Improving a Perfect Model\n\nWhat could Blockchain possibly offer to make the perfect transition even better? Hear me out. Let's say I'm missing that one card to round out my deck. A common problem in *Magic* centers around not having a certain rare or ultra-rare. What are you going to do? Ask to borrow it? Back in the day, you'd be out of your mind letting someone borrow an expensive card. They could lose it, damage it, or even worse, destroy it (which is somehow more unbearable than losing it). I know I would never let anyone borrow my *Black Lotus*. No way!\n\n![](https://product-images.tcgplayer.com/fit-in/400x558/8687.jpg)\n\n> Which I owned and cherished! Alpha, used it in tournaments. Wasn't perfect condition, but my parents sold it as part of a bulk sale while I was away at college. Only lost about $50k USD in total I'd think...\n\nNFT gaming removes all of those risks and concerns. Splinterlands has created a [marketplace](https://splinterlands.com/?p=market&tab=rentals) as well as 3rd party websites like [Peakmonsters](https://peakmonsters.com/) where you can actually rent those cards you haven't acquired yet that make your deck perfect. There's even the option to rent entire decks! This is where the perfect translation of real-world to Blockchain becomes even better. I can now rent out that *Black Lotus* with no concern about damages or losses, because it's an NFT, so there's literally no way any of that could happen. If you're a CCG player, Blockchain is the future. All the benefits, all the rules, all the systems, and a whole bunch of extra improvements. Trust me when I say it...Splinterlands is the *Magic: The Gathering* of Blockchain!",

      "slug": "gamification-nfts-and-defi",
      "body": "***Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a pretty big deal right now, and new DEXes seem to appear on a daily basis. However, Decentralized Exchanges aren't exactly super exciting, at least not to regular folks. But several entities have seen the undeniable allure of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Blockchain-based gaming and are working to incorporate these winning elements into their own DeFi offerings. Let's dig in!***\n\n## On Your Marks, Get Set: Game!\n\nPeople learn the most when they have fun, and even as kids, the games we played with our friends (both digitally and in the real-world) helped to shape us as individuals and informed how we see ourselves in relation to others. And in terms of the gaming industry...well, it's absolutely massive! I always remember being ridiculed for playing games like *DOOM*, *Half-Life* and* Warcraft III* as a kid, but now that I'm an adult, pretty much everyone I know is a gamer! *My how the tables have turned!*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8PEA38x.jpg)\n\nThe modern gaming industry is already gigantic and only expanding. Statistics provided by [Accenture](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/global-gaming-industry-value-now-exceeds-300-billion-new-accenture-report-finds.htm) indicate that, as of May 2021, the total combined value of the gaming industry is over $300 billion. That's like, more than the value of both the movie and music industries combined! *Great Scott!*\n\nMuch of this has been driven by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that has forced many people to find other forms of income and entertainment (most notably through mobile gaming). It's also because games are fun and engaging with most participants having a hard time peeling themselves away from their devices for even a second (I'm talking about myself, aren't I?)\n\nAnd naturally Blockchain-based games are on the rise, especially with the renewed interest in crypto. Some of the more noteworthy games we have here on MSQ.io include [Blankos Block Party](https://blankos.com/), [Star Atlas](https://staratlas.com/) and [Splinterlands](https://splinterlands.com/) to name just a few.\n\nThese games differ from their traditional counterparts in that all of the in-game assets exist on a Blockchain and actually belong to the users themselves. In other words, these items are effectively Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that players can use in-game or sell to others on different exchanges around the cryptosphere. It's a totally new form of ownership that yields real, tangible rewards for participants!\n\nNow for the true Galaxy Brains out there who have witnessed the popularity of DeFi, Blockchain Gaming and NFTs, it's clear that three 'heads' are better than one. No, I'm not talking about some kind of crypto-version of Cerberus (though I'm pretty sure I saw an NFT like that). What I'm saying is, *'Why have one when you can have them all?'*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qmD0N3l.png)\n\nSo maybe you don't agree with my analogy and you've realized I put this meme together all willy-nilly, but I think you catch my drift. In order for DeFi to gain popularity and be accepted across the board, platforms will need to appeal to the sensibilities and tastes of the masses. And what better way to accomplish such a Mammoth feat than to take NFTs, Blockchain games and DeFi and mush them all together in one wondrous ball of scintillating awesomeness?\n\n## Keep it Simple, Fun, and Decentralized\n\nHow do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time? Well hopefully you don't eat elephants, but that's actually the real answer: You don't. If something seems intimidating or overwhelming, it's a serious turnoff for most people, so if you know anything about DeFi, it's uh...not *exactly* that easy to get into.\n\nFor newcomers it's likely to be anything but simple: DeFi platforms have no intermediaries attached to them or help desk for participants to visit in case something goes wrong. Right now, if you're into DeFi, the potential for high gains is there, but so too does the possibility of suffering significant losses. That's why you be extra careful and make sure you do your research beforehand (or at least use a good platform).\n\nA [Cointelegraph article](https://cointelegraph.com/news/a-defi-bank-bets-simplicity-and-gamification-will-yield-mass-market-success) published on 27th May 2021 by Connor Sephton discusses [Kalmar](https://kalmar.io/), 'The First DeFi Bank' that hopes to employ a gamified approach to fast-track DeFi adoption.\n\nAt present, the platform offers leveraged interest on cryptoassets and an NFT fundraiser that allows capital accrued from NFTs to be exchanged for real rewards. Here users receive NFTs at random, and later on, these items can be sold on NFT markets or exchanged for different rewards. Check out some of these Kalmy NFTS available through Kalmar. Pretty cute, right?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0G1kgXv.png)\n\nThe actual gaming platform is allegedly still in the works but will allow users to earn rewards in different skill-based games and by competing in tournaments. The great thing about gamification in something like DeFi is that it acts as an excellent teaching tool and gives users the opportunity to improve their skills and understanding of DeFi as well as other crypto-related products and services. Users who want to learn more and increase their yields can use gamified platforms to grow their confidence and abilities before moving on to more technical (and potentially more profitable) activities.\n\n## So Which Platforms Use Gamification?\n\nOne of the best examples of gamification in crypto can be found in popular DeFi platform [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/). One part of the platform that seems to be gaining a lot of traction is their weekly [Community Farm Auctions](https://pancakeswap.finance/farms/auction). So how does this work?\n\n- Projects will first submit an application to sponsor a yield farm and/or pool on PancakeSwap\n- If the application is successful, the project will then be whitelisted\n- A project's whitelisted wallet can then be connected to the Auction page\n- When the auction is live, a 'Place Bid' button will appear\n- CAKE can then be committed during the auction to place bids and compete with other projects for an available farm\n- If **unsuccessful**, CAKE can be reclaimed after the auction\n- If **successful**, the project's farm will begin as specified. The CAKE committed will not be returned and will instead go into PancakeSwap's weekly CAKE burn. As long as a project remains whitelisted, it is possible to take part in each new auction\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MX9EL8o.png)\n\nAccording to [PancakeSwap itself](https://pancakeswap.medium.com/?p=e285518fb874), the first community auction recently ended with 20 projects bidding CAKE, and as a result, a total of 57,380 CAKE is due to be burned! Five projects emerged victorious, namely Babycake, Binamon, Metahero, Wall Street Games and MacaronSwap. The burning of CAKE will effectively reduce the overall available supply and should increase the price of each individual CAKE token. It appears that PancakeSwap's first Community Farm Auction was a big success, and on this basis, I'm sure it'll only continue to grow in popularity.\n\nThere are more gamified features on PancakeSwap over and above its Community Farm Auctions. Users can also participate in lotteries by buying tickets with CAKE. One lucky winner will receive the full pot that usually consists of thousands of CAKE tokens (or tens of thousands of Dollars). There's also the opportunity to take part in Prediction Markets in order to earn CAKE, but this part of the platform is still in its Beta phase and has not been officially implemented as-yet.\n\nPancakeSwap boasts collectible NFTs on its platform as well that serve as profile pictures for participants. Once an NFT has been purchased and a profile pic set, users can choose from one of three teams (Syrup Storm, Fearsome Flippers or Chaotic Cakers) in order to earn prizes. The better a user's team performs in battles, the bigger the prizes they earn. Big winners get big winnings!\n\n## Role Playing Games Meet DeFi\n\nI'm still waiting for a [Warhammer 40K](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-WW/Warhammer-40-000) themed DeFi platform, but until then, great platforms like [DungeonSwap](https://dungeonswap.app/) will more than do the trick. *Maybe ye fancy yerself a great knight? Or perhaps ye believe yerself ta be a moighty wizard?* Well fear not my fantasy-loving friend, DungeonSwap is just the answer to all your Medieval and Decentralized Finance needs!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Qdf2JYq.jpg)\n\n> Don't worry, he's just burnin' tokens, it's fine!\n\nYes indeed sword-wielders and dragon-slayers, think of DungeonSwap as the *Dark Souls* of DeFi (I'm sorry, I had to, OK?) or PancakeSwap, but instead of bunnies, it's *Dungeons & Dragons*. DungeonSwap hosts all the features one would expect in a DeFi platform including an Exchange (Trading Market), Liquidity Pool (Liquidity Fountain), Yield Farming (Fantasy Farm) and Staking Pool (Alchemist's Pool). However, where it differs from other platforms is in its RPG feature known as *The Dungeon*.\n\nAt present, players may choose from a Tutorial called 'The Training Field' and two other campaigns. At time of writing, players will pay 0.7 DND (the native token of DungeonSwap) in order to undergo training. Upon successfully completing the tutorial, would-be adventurers will earn some basic equipment to help them with the challenges laid out before them.\n\nThe first of the two campaigns is called 'The Mad Wizard's Underground Lair.' This is recommended for adventurers with equipment that has at least a two-star rating. Players will pay 1 DND entry fee and stand the chance of receiving jackpot winnings of up to 11,472.28 DND. Naturally this all depends on whether adventurers actually survive the Mad Wizard's wrath and find his vast vault of treasure!\n\nThe second campaign known as 'The Grand Colosseum' sees players facing up against a swathe of hideous creatures bred by the mysterious Mages' Cabal. This more advanced campaign will cost adventurers 10 DND to enter with the jackpot prize totaling 14,860.88 DND should they succeed in their quest. This particular scenario is recommended only to those players who possess three-star rated equipment or better. There is a third campaign called 'The Immortal Lich's Forbidding Castle,' but it is not available to the public at time of writing.\n\nDungeonSwap plans to add further features to their platform in the near future including an NFT Market and 'Smithy' for upgrading equipment. With its RPG sensibilities and Medieval theme, DungeonSwap certainly sets itself apart from other DeFi platforms and appeals to a generation of users who grew up on tabletop games, fantasy novels and RPGs on Desktop and Console.\n\n## Are You Not Entertained?\n\nMaybe gamification and NFTs aren't for everyone...they probably aren't. But just because gamified platforms exist doesn't mean that more traditional DeFi platforms are simply going to disappear. Quite the opposite I think. DeFi is still very much in its infancy, and the way the industry will look and work within the next few years will probably be significantly different from how it is now. It's hard to say, but if nothing else, we should see new features and greater innovation coming through in waves in the world of DeFi as time progresses.\n\nI'm a big believer in the concept of 'novelty' when it comes to hooking people in and keeping them entertained. Gamified platforms certainly have a lot going for them and have the potential to reach a much wider market more rapidly than those platforms that are more technical and niche in nature. Your tech can be great and your team super professional, but if you don't cater to your target markets' tastes, don't expect them to take notice, let alone stick around.\n\nI think we'll see a lot more crossover between DeFi, NFTs and Blockchain-based games in the future. This is how innovation happens really, and those platforms that manage to capture and present all those different elements within the cryptosphere stand to benefit the most in the long-run.",

      "body": "***If you look up Bitcoin on [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bitcoin/), you will see that Nigeria is usually ranked the number one country by search interest. But why is this happening if the Nigerian government recently announced a crackdown on Crypto?***\n\n## Nigeria's Crises\n\nNigeria is a country plagued by social unrest and rampant inflation.\n\nIn October 2020, the most populous African nation saw massive [public demonstrations](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-54678345/) against police brutality. After authorities tore into protesters with tear gas and water cannons, 69 people were killed and many more horribly injured.\n\nThe Nigerian government reacted by freezing the bank accounts of organizations that were helping protesters. They also froze the accounts of people speaking out against government policies.\n\nThe majority of goods purchased in Nigeria are imported. In 2019, Nigeria's [imported goods](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/nga/) accounted for $52.5 billion, making it the 50th largest trade destination in the world.\n\nThe Nigerian currency is the Naira, which is highly volatile. Throughout 2021, the inflation rate has hovered around 18%. To hedge against this, Nigerians prefer to pay for their imported goods with US Dollars. However, US Dollars are hard to come by.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EzZLZyt.jpg)\n\n> Money printer go brrrr!\n\n## Crypto to the Rescue!\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin trading platform [Paxful](https://paxful.com/), Nigeria is now second only to the US for Bitcoin trading. The Dollar volume of crypto received by users in Nigeria in May 2021 was $2.4 billion, up from $684 million in December 2020.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pIBNZYF.png)\n\nDespite talks of regulating and banning cryptocurrencies in Nigeria, the market keeps going from strength to strength. Distrustful of banks that can freeze your account, Nigerians are using cryptocurrencies to feed their families, run their businesses and educate their children.\n\nThe young and educated population along with increased internet adoption has helped to facilitate the exponential adoption of Bitcoin. The borderless nature of Bitcoin makes it a viable option for making both local and international payments. [Cryptofully.com](https://www.cryptofully.com/) is a great example in this case. Cryptofully allows people to send money to Nigeria using Peer-2-Peer (P2P) networking. The crypto is then converted into Naira. Using the Cryptofully app, users can send and receive crypto, pay bills and earn rewards.\n\nNigerians are also taking advantage of the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Industry and using DeFi loans to run their businesses. Being unbanked is no longer a barrier to raising capital and running a business in Nigeria.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/h98e5nX.jpg)\n\n[Xend Finance](https://xend.finance/) is a Nigerian DeFi start-up that enables credit unions to access DeFi for their members by using decentralized stablecoins such as DAI and BUSD. Members can take out loans and earn interest on their savings. In a country that has seen 3 massive currency devaluations over the last 3 years, projects such as Xend Finance offer hope and a way out of poverty for many Nigerians. \n\n> *'We target non-crypto users, financially underserved users and users in unstable economies that need their assets to be protected by any means necessary. We are the answers to their prayers'* - Ugochukwu Aronu, CEO and founder of Xend Finance\n\n## Foreign 'Intervention' (The Good Kind)\n\nOne cryptocurrency that has set its sights firmly on the African market is [Electroneum](https://electroneum.com/), a mobile-based digital payments platform powered by Blockchain. It enables people to send transactions anywhere in the world quickly and affordably. Users can also top-up their mobile phones and pay utility bills using the native coin, ETN. The Nigerian market is a perfect fit for Electroneum. Users are generally young mobile phone users who are keen to adopt new technologies.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BUh6oud.png)\n\nThe Nigerian government has announced plans to release its own digital currency later in 2021. However, it remains to be seen if this is embraced as enthusiastically as independent cryptocurrencies.",

      "body": "***Regulation, regulation, regulation. Hardly a day goes by in the cryptosphere without hearing the word. The US Senate just passed a $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Bill to refurbish much of the nation's roadways, ports and bridges, as well as make provisions for and circumvent many of the negative effects of climate change. So how does crypto enter into this? Well, the funds for infrastructure need to come from somewhere, and it seems that tighter regulation of crypto is part of the equation...***\n\n## The Cost of Living\n\nIn recent years, humanity has prospered as a result of technological innovation and the streamlining of processes that make life more convenient, safe and comfortable. We've managed to spread across the length and breadth of the planet in a matter of decades, conquered innumerable diseases and created an intricate and ever-evolving network of information, businesses and services. As a species, we really are at the top of our game: apex predators with no other species to rival us.\n\nProgress comes at a cost though, and with the way we've built our societies and our economy, the price has been tremendous. In a [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/global-debt-hits-all-time-high-as-pandemic-boosts-spending-need#:~:text=World%20Debt%20Reaches%20Record%20%24281%20Trillion%20%2D%20Bloomberg) by Sydney Maki, as of February 2021, total world debt stands at about $281 trillion, and you can be sure this figure has risen since then. Imagine you had 281 million briefcases, each containing $1 million. That's what $281 trillion looks like. You could also think of it as every single person living in the US receiving about $930,000 each. Yikes!\n\nModern economics is something of an absurdity: rampant debt, money printing, skyrocketing consumer prices, ballooning inflation, the destruction of livelihoods...need I go on? Oh yeah, Coronavirus hasn't made things easier either, but that's hardly news now, is it? The cost of living has risen considerably over time, and the main driver behind this is inflation. In a 2016 Economicshelp.org [article](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/11826/inflation/why-does-the-cost-of-living-keep-rising/) by Tejvan Pettinger, most Central Banks believe that a moderate inflation rate is conducive to healthy economic growth. This also depends on the growth of incomes outpacing inflation as well as several other factors.\n\nThe [2019 Financial Disruptions Survey](https://s2.q4cdn.com/437609071/files/doc_news/research/2019/financial-disruptions-survey.pdf) conducted by [TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/) indicates that Millennials in the US believe the increased cost of living is the biggest threat to their financial wellbeing. Meanwhile, Boomers and Generation X are becoming increasingly concerned about the cost of healthcare (which is already alarmingly high in the US). Keep in mind that all of this occurred a little while before the Coronavirus pandemic, so in all likelihood, the concerns of adults in the US (and across the world) have only multiplied.\n\n## Rising Government Expenditure\n\nGiven how things have been going over the past couple of decades, it should come as no surprize that US Goverment spending has risen over time. In fact, expenditure hit an all-time high in the first Quarter of 2021. Take a look at this chart courtesy of [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-spending):\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ldPK3RF.png)\n\nIt would seem that the Government's appetite for spending has only increased over the years, and if the $1.2 trillion cost of the Infrastructure Bill is anything to go by, it's clear that the trend is far from dead. As I mentioned earlier, this money isn't just going to come out of nowhere, so the Bill contains several provisions and proposals on how to go about acquiring these funds. If a [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/us/politics/infrastructure-bill-passes.html) by Emily Cochrane of [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/international/) is right, this means reallocating unspent pandemic funds, delaying Trump-era policies regarding drug companies and Medicare patients, and regulating cryptocurrency more stringently.\n\nThe buck doesn't stop with the Infrastructure Bill though: a further $3.5 trillion will be required in order to finance the Senate's social policy budget (the Reconciliation Bill), which will necessitate a tax increase. However, these taxes will allegedly target big corporations, large inheritances and the wealthy. Regardless of where the money actually comes from, Government spending isn't going to decrease anytime soon and will require significant backing. Shortfalls are also expected to add billions of Dollars to the deficit, which apparently isn't really that big of a deal to the majority of senators.\n\n## So How Does This Affect Crypto?\n\nRight, so the real question here is how the Infrastructure Bill will impact the Blockchain Industry. Simply put, all crypto 'brokers' will be required to carry out Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures on their users. The big problem here is that the Infrastructure Bill's language, especially regarding crypto, is pretty damn awful. This is because the definition of a 'broker' is ill-defined at best, meaning that miners, validators and even protocol developers could be considered 'brokers.' I'm sure you can see the problem here. Judging by reactions on Twitter...well, see for yourself:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/N6Zrpvg.png)\n\nThere's no doubt that Ebeling is right about the fact that most people responsible for this legislation categorically do not understand the mechanics or functions of digital assets. Hastily passing legislation on crypto is simply not a good idea since it affects many members of the middle class, stifles innovation and pushes development overseas towards more favorable environments. To call Senate's passing of the Infrastructure Bill with the current language on crypto ham-fisted would be generous. Crypto is an emerging sector and is extremely nuanced, so making sweeping generalizations and failing to protect important parts of its own infrastructure is irresponsible, reckless and, ultimately, counterintuitive.\n\nNow before you totally lose heart, there was some pushback on the Bill, and quite a lot for that matter. According to an [article](https://cryptobriefing.com/senate-passes-vote-anti-crypto-infrastructure-bill/) by Nathan van der Heyden of [Crypto Briefing](https://cryptobriefing.com/), two amendments were put forward after the crypto community came together to take a stand and defend against the provisions of the Bill. The first amendment put forward by Senators Warner, Sinema and Portman attempted to exclude Proof-of-Work (PoW) miners, hardware manufacturers and service providers from being labeled as 'Brokers.' The crypto community was unhappy with this though since it made no provision for Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators and was effectively seen as a direct attack on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) as well as an attempt to scuttle the emerging Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6WT50kZ.png)\n\nAnother more crypto-friendly amendment was then put forward by Senators Lummis, Wyden and Toomey and found far more support from the crypto community. Finally a joint amendment was put together by all relevant Senators. The problem here is that the amendment came in late and therefore required everyone to unanimously agree in order for it to pass. Only one Senator, Richard Shelby, blocked the bipartisan amendment after having his own $50 billion amendment to increase military spending denied. See the problem of centralized power? Yeah, I know you do...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/s2UT5AP.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rPxIbkx.png)\n\nThe Infrastructure Bill passed without any amendments or clarification on Twitter. This doesn't seem to bode well for crypto and innovation in the US. Again, this is a short-sighted, hackneyed move to try and capitalize on an industry that legislators know little or nothing about. But how can we expect any kind of radical change without these kinds of instances? They're 100% inevitable. Crypto, Blockchain and Web 3.0 are disrupting the status quo, so for governments, globalists, hegemons and big corporates, it poses a significant threat to their bases of power.\n\n## Time to Give Up?\n\n*Hell no!* This is the time to fight, more than ever before! The future of crypto is the world's future. If we give up on it, we may as well just give up on the one chance at freedom we actually have. Those who have entrenched their power and authority seek to deepen their influence and remain on their thrones forevermore. It's up to all of us to make sure that doesn't happen!\n\nNow before you go calling me a lunatic (which I very well might be), keep in mind that the Senate does not hold absolute power and that the House of Representatives will still need to vote on the Infrastructure Bill. Besides this, Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, has said she won't take up the Infrastructure Bill until the Senate deals with the Reconciliation Bill (which is yet to be written). September 15th is the date by which the legislation is meant to be submitted, but it will likely undergo a number of changes as it moves along the line from committee to committee.\n\nThere are ways and means to fight the Infrastructure Bill, and just because the Senate passed it doesn't mean it will actually stick. Having said this, it doesn't mean it *won't* stick. The point here is that nothing is set in stone right now, which means there's still hope that things will turn around. Making it harder for crypto companies to operate in the US will simply send money and development offshore, so when someone actually wakes up and realizes this, there may even be some provisions to *protect* the crypto industry in order to foster innovation and encourage real socioeconomic growth.\n\nNo matter what happens in the coming months, regulation is here and will continue to develop over time. More importantly, crypto, DeFi, Blockchain and NFTs are here to stay. It seems like every single day, more and more people are questioning the systems that govern their lives and taking steps to help dismantle those structures that have kept them from prospering. The best way to help fight harmful regulation is to get involved, have your say and do what you can to help make the world a better place. You have a voice, so make it heard!\n\n*Venit enim potest:* Come what may...",

      "body": "***Popular games come and go, but some of the same issues keep on popping up, time and time again. While gaming will always have its problems, there are a few key issues that could be solved through the use of Blockchain Technology. Let's check it out!***\n\n## Big Games, Big Problems\n\nThe issues faced by games obviously depends on what you choose to play.  Let's look at some possible ways to make significant improvements in three popular games, namely [Apex Legends](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends), [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/), and [Call of Duty: Warzone](https://www.callofduty.com/warzone). So in my opinion, some of the biggest pain points in these games include wasted time getting skins, broken metas, and, naturally, rampant hacking. However, some of the aforementioned candidates seem to suffer more as a result of these issues than others. And modern game developers tend to simply repeat themselves when it comes to these mechanics. Thankfully Blockchain has the answers to some of the biggest and most prevalent problems currently plaguing online gaming.\n\n## You Unlock It - We Own It\n\nI'm a huge fan of *Apex Legends*, a battle royale-style game. I have been running around like a madman as my favorite character, Octane, since he first showed up in the Outlands.\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/txUj8lVMySlDRl34rwhFZCOQigE=/0x0:2048x1152/920x613/filters:focal(905x160:1231x486):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/63258782/apex_legends_octane_celebration_2048.0.jpg)\n\n> Metal legs and speed. What more do you need? Hey...that rhymes!\n\nFun fact: Octane was inspired by a speed run of 'The Gaunlet' in *Titan Fall 2* by player Cash_mayo. Anyway, the one thing better than getting that dub with your friends, to me, is unlocking new skins for my stim-injecting speed freak. Whether it be skins for your character or skins for guns, people have shown a HUGE interest in acquiring them. *Apex*, like many other modern games, boosts this need for them by introducing time-locked events that have you pounding the pavement to reach a goal and unlock a skin before the time runs out. Why put in all the extra time and effort? Because you may *never* have access to that skin you want again!\n\n![](https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/s7-holo-day-bash/holo-day-2020-prize-track-v3.jpg)\n\n> The Holo-Day Bash event gave you a little over a month to finish, but I...didn't.\n\nThe fact still remains: even after unlocking those skins, if you stop playing the game, that time you spent grinding away is essentially reduced to 'a waste of time,' or I guess glory stories for the future at the very least. With so many players investing time and energy into something that doesn't even affect gameplay, you'd think they'd have a greater desire to own those skins outright. I know I do. Regardless, it shows there is an existing and active market in which to integrate Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) using Blockchain technology. Imagine owning those skins you worked so hard to unlock. Now imagine being able to sell those time-locked skins to someone who desperately wants and is willing to pay good money for them.\n\n### NFTs...It's Showtime!\n\nThere are plenty of skins I have unlocked but never actually used (and have no interest in using). But if I could sell these items as NFTs? *Sign me up!* More importantly, skin ownership would likely translate past a game's popular lifetime. Imagine how much money an old time-locked [Halo](https://www.halowaypoint.com/) event skin would sell for as an NFT, regardless of whether people still played it or not. Nostalgia in gaming has proven to be a force to be reckoned with as we continue to see classic titles being remastered. I personally can't wait for the soon-to-be-released *Diablo II: Resurrected*.\n\nNFTs have recently become a booming sector within the Blockchain industry, and digital ownership of skins used in popular mainstream games would empower and see tons of new players joining the NFT community. It would also create an everlasting community associated with any popular game that successfully managed to integrate NFTs into their platform. It would sustain a consistent revenue stream for older 'forgotten' games for players, collectors, and developers alike. So everyone wins. Now...when do we start?\n\n## New Meta, Old Problems\n\nI can't even recall how many times I played a game and it was updated with a new gun or class, and all of a sudden, the variety of builds or strategies seemed to boil down to one choice, or you just...couldn't compete. Ah, the 'Meta' of the update. Now I haven't personally played the game *Valorant*, but my love of esports has proven this to be a great example.\n\n![](https://wp.stanforddaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png)\n\n> This may be the new big boy in esports. I may need to product test this out...you know, for work reasons and such.\n\nUsually described as a hybrid of [Counter-Strike](https://blog.counter-strike.net/) and [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/), Valorant is quickly becoming one of the top games in global esports. Pros and streamers have been abandoning their preferred games for the apparent new hotness that is *Valorant*. Don't get me wrong, there is a meta present within the pro community, and it consists of a small variety of gun choices. One person who, mind you, used a controller instead of a keyboard (which is unheard of) decided to try something else and gained notoriety (or glory, depending on who you ask) by stomping pros and streamers alike with a new meta using an arguably 'broken' gun.\n\nEnter [Dasnerth](https://twitter.com/Dasnerth), an unsponsored player who didn't just climb the ranks to the pros league against keyboard users with a controller, but absolutely dominated everything in his path, using one gun and one gun only: a shotgun tantamount to the ultimate noob tube, [The ACS-12 Judge](https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Judge).\n\n![](https://guides.gamepressure.com/valorant/gfx/word/124305625.jpg)\n\n> Repeatedly complained about by participants, yet remained unchanged until Version 3.0. Maybe a tiny dose of community governance would have helped out here...\n\nNow I'm not saying what Dasnerth can do everyone can do, but it opened the door to the idea that a section of the community started running with, something called the ['Judge, Jury and Execution'](https://www.twitch.tv/valorant/clip/IncredulousNaiveCocoaKeepo?lang=de-DE) meta. While the Judge was always known to be a new player weapon because of its one-shot kills, it wasn't until Dasnerth that pro-level play saw anyone using it.\n\nEven though multiple updates provided by *Valorant* have fixed several other issues, when it comes to *The Judge* and its obviously overpowered stats, the community has ardently argued against it. However, nothing happened until the [v3.0 update](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-3-0/): months of irritated players in the community wanting something to change, update after update, yet no nerf to *The Judge*.\n\n### Who You Gonna Call?\n\nIf only there was a system that would allow the community to vote for or elect leaders to decide balancing changes. Oh wait. Yep, forgot...Blockchain! Introducing Blockchain-based governance to player pools, even with centralized updates, could show developers exactly what the community wants. It would allow major game companies to maintain ownership of their property while servicing updates that fit and reflect the community's sentiment. Annoying metas that previously lasted for months or years could become focus points to fix as they arise. The community would have an active voice in the development of the system instead of the largely unheard one it currently has.\n\n## Cheaters\n\nThen there's the Big Kahuna of online gaming. Cheaters, hackers, grifters, whatever you wanna call 'em. They are here, they are many and they simply...suck. Arguably the most popular streamer game at present, *Call of Duty: Warzone* has no equal when it comes to cheaters within the community.\n\n![](https://www.callofduty.com/content/dam/atvi/callofduty/cod-touchui/warzone/social/wz-social-share.jpg)\n\n> Ever wanted to be killed while parachuting down before you even start playing a game? And by a person not even aiming directly at you? Join the movement that is *Warzone.* It's fun...sometimes.\n\nCheats and hacks seem to have created a Wild West of matchmaking. More often than not, you'll find yourself pitted against someone who is cheating. Now, the types of cheats people use vary from garden variety aimbots to location exposure, and even the unfortunately entertaining to watch in replay videos, [magnetic bullets](https://easternmirrornagaland.com/new-call-of-duty-warzone-hack-lets-cheaters-kill-players-using-ghost-bullets/). You literally don't even have to look at someone, and the hack will curve your bullet to act as a heat seeking missile. Poor bastards.\n\n*Call of Duty: Warzone* also has the wonderful problem of slow updates to fix these hacks, opting instead to rely on the community to report and allow targeted bans of cheaters, which, as you would expect, is extremely...inefficient: centralized servers running checks on individual reports that anyone can claim against anyone else playing, sometimes for no reason at all. You know how you can effectively prevent cheating on *Call of Duty: Warzone*? Integrating server access with Blockchain technology is one solid approach. Blockchain ledger systems have proven to be the most secure way of storing and maintaining data integrity. However, this integration is easier said than done. \n\n> I think I may need to expand on this topic. If you're interested, I'll have a follow-up article for all of you in a couple of days, so stay tuned!\n\n## Get It Going!\n\nGamers are united on some of these issues and possibly unaware of others, but all it takes is greater impetus to get the ball rolling. It's possible for skins to provide some benefits to users for their time investment, just as much as the companies that created them. Governance voting gives players the opportunity to have their say in how things evolve and makes for a more inclusive, democratic experience. It's likely that centralized data collection and analysis will still form a large part of the process, but rapid community-based decisions to correct meta issues will only contribute to the long-term value of online gaming. The upshots of these integrations include higher engagement within old and new communities, no opportunities to cheat and a more streamlined experience for all.\n\nThere's no disputing the fact that Blockchain technology alone is capable of providing these benefits and that game developers need to move towards adopting these solutions as soon as possible.",

After a successful pilot test, Akoin is now setting its sights on handling up to $5 million worth of transactions every month. Let's explore this marvelous development in more detail and learn a little more about Akon and the people behind Akoin...***\n\n## Akon: A Visionary for Africa\n\n[Akon](https://twitter.com/Akon) is something of a unique character. On top of being an award-winning singer, he is also a record producer, entrepreneur and philanthropist. He is mainly known as a solo artist but has released several tracks featuring popular artists such as *Eminem* (Smack That) and *Snoop Dogg* (I Wanna Love You).\n\nYou might be wondering how a Grammy Award-winning singer got into crypto? Well, in 2014, Akon invested in Bitcoin, so he's been aware of crypto and Blockchain technology for some time now.\n\nHowever, there was a defining moment when mere interest galvanized into the idea of creating his own cryptoasset. Apparently after returning from a trip to Dakar, Akon tried to convert West African CFA franc into Euros at a French Exchange.\n\nThe exchange staff told the Star, 'Unfortunately we don't take them.' He was left with a pocket full of currency that he couldn't spend or do anything with. This was a real shock to him because CFA francs is the currency used in many French-speaking West African countries (including his own native country, Senegal).\n\nThis was the moment Akon realized that Africa needed its own currency that could be accepted throughout the continent and even beyond.\n\nIn an interview with [Bloomberg Quint](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/singer-akon-is-launching-a-cryptocurrency-building-senegal-city/), the singer stated:\n\n> 'It really just opened my eyes...that really catapulted the energy to say \"we have to have our own currency. I don't care what it takes - we are going to fix this.\"'\n\nAkon announced plans to launch his own crypto in 2019 at the [Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity](https://www.canneslions.com/).\n\n### Crypto Philanthropy\n\nIn addition to being a musician and crypto entrepreneur, Akon is well-known for his philanthropic work. For one, he is the founder of [Lighting Africa](https://www.lightingafrica.org/), an organization that provides off-grid electricity to energy-deprived communities.\n\nAccording to the Lighting Africa website, approximately 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa live without grid electricity. Instead, they are forced to use kerosene lamps and candles as sources of light and heat. The fumes from these mediums cause respiratory problems and are a major fire hazard.\n\nEnergy-poverty is a major barrier to educational and business opportunities in Africa. Lighting Africa is working across 25 African countries and has major plans to expand the operation throughout the continent.\n\nAkon is also involved with [Konfidence Foundation](http://konfidence.org/), a charity committed to helping underprivileged children. Akon founded the organization in 2007 with the help of his mother, Kine Gueye Thiam. The initiative aims to empower children in Senegal by providing them with education, mentoring programs and scholarships. Interestingly enough, Akon created a song titled *Oh Africa* with Keri Hilson. Part of the proceeds from this song and subsequent tour went directly towards financing the Konfidence Foundation.\n\nA cryptocurrency enthusiast to say the least, Akon has plans to build [AKON CITY](https://akoncity.com) in Senegal. AKON CITY will be a futuristic, Wakanda-style smart city powered by [Akoin](https://www.akoin.io/).\n\n> AKON CITY definitely deserves an article of its, own so I'll be following-up in a future piece. Watch this space!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4MJAf49.jpg)\n\n## So What is AKOIN?\n\nAkoin is a [Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/?locale=en)-based cryptocurrency designed to empower entrepreneurs in Africa and beyond. Africa is home to 54 countries and over 40 volatile fiat currencies. With spiraling inflation, strict government legislation and thousands of unbanked adults, it's difficult for Africans to set up businesses and save money. Akoin aims to solve these problems by providing a suite of tools to help people set up businesses and trade both locally and internationally.\n\n> *Young entrepreneurs in Africa are facing real hardships in creating and building businesses — problems that have hampered sustained development for too long* - Akon, Chairman and Co-Founder of Akoin\n\nAkoin also funds a foundation that runs programs for identifying and encouraging entrepreneurs in Africa. Some of these programs include education, mentoring Akoin ambassadors, business incubation, community networking and activations. The foundation invests in Decentralized Apps (dApps) joining the Ecosystem, leveraging them as token distribution vehicles to ensure Akoin maintains its utility for its end-users.\n\nAkoin underwent testing at the [Mwale Medical and Technology City (MMTC)](https://www.mwalemedicalandtechnologycity.com/). The MMTC is a fascinating development in Kenya. It's built around a 5,000 bed state-of-the-art hospital. With solar powered lighting, a waste-to-energy facility and rainwater harvesting, the city aims to be completely self-sufficient and entirely sustainable in the near future.\n\nThe initial testing phase for Akoin ran from November 2020 to July 2021 and involved residents and employees of MMTC. People were paid and could effect payments using Akoin. The transactions were then converted into cell phone minutes or other forms of exchange. According to Akoin, the test was a huge success, and the aim is to have all residents and businesses in the city transacting solely with Akoin by September 2022...that's about a year from now, so we'll find out soon enough!\n\n![](twitter:AkoinOfficial/status/1424701277196505090)\n\n## Where Is This All Headed?\n\nA spokesperson for Akoin stated that by the end of 2022, Akoin is expected to become the 'second-most popular payment platform after M-Pesa,' a mobile-phone-based money transfer and micro-financing service popular in Africa and other parts of the developing world.\n\nThese are grand plans indeed, and I personally wonder how long it is before a movie or documentary is made on the whole Akoin project. I for one would *definitely* watch it. Wait a minute, that's a great idea! Remember movie moguls, you heard it here first, so I'll expect some credit for the idea!\n\nI will be following Akoin with great interest and bringing you updates on its progress. With a famous co-founder, huge plans for expansion across Africa, designs to build a self-sufficient smart city in Senegal, and the sustainable MMTC project, you wonder if the project will succeed or simply disappear. Only time will tell I guess...",

Whether it's their art, their exciting communities, or the unique releases planned in their projects, there is definitely something here to grab your interest. Today we bring you the awesomeness that is Parallel...***\n\n## About Parallel\n\n> Earth, far off in the future: drained from supporting human life, the planet has fallen into a desperate energy crisis. In order to resolve this, Humanity attempted to unlock the solution by hastily experimenting with antimatter. Unfortunately the consequences have been nothing short of devastating...\n\n[Parallel](https://parallel.life/) is a Sci-Fi collectible card game complete with NFTs currently being built on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain. It consists of 5 different 'Parallel streams' (collections) which come with their own strengths, strategies and abilities. They battle for control over Earth, their common ancestral home. The five collections within Parallel are *Earthen, Marcolian, Augencore, Kathari* and *The Shroud*. Each one of these Parallel's have a unique backstory that you can check out [here](https://parallel.life/parallels/).\n\nThe Parallel game is composed of digital collectible cards which can be used to build a deck to be played in an online/mobile game which is currently **in development**. The cards have different rarities, namely Common, Uncommon and Rare. This Sci-Fi NFT game will feature a dynamic interface complete with beautiful custom art. In order to play the game you will need at least one complete deck of cards for one Parallel you want to play as. All the cards are available for viewing [here](https://parallel.life/cards/). The following is just a small sample of the amazing artwork that appears on the cards.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nwWkoUp.jpg=250x)![](https://i.imgur.com/U7JQuLn.jpg=250x)\n\n## What's Next for Parallel?\n\nParallel has a lot planned for the future that you can check out in the Roadmap below. The main releases include more NFT drops as well as game development, but they have a few other cool things in the works too!\n\nOne amazing aspect of Parallel is how they are reaching new heights in terms of coolness. Here is a recent test they did where players can open Parallel card packs in Augmented Reality (AR):\n\n![](twitter:ParallelNFT/status/1426788605847117826?s=20)\n\n> *'This is an early test of the AR pack opening experience for Parallel's next drop. Both pack opening and card flipping happen on tap. However, we haven’t hooked it up to on-chain pack generation to the cards, and we haven’t engineered our card flip sound as-yet'*\n\nTo get your hands on some of these awesome Parallel cards, you can go directly to their OpenSea page and pick some up. Alternatively, you can choose to wait for their next pack drop coming sometime in October.\n\nWe also managed to find a sneak peak on their Twitter of physical cards in the works!\n\n![](twitter:ParallelNFT/status/1426678059902586889?s=20)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SiK7Qj5.png)\n\n> Parallel's Official Roadmap\n\n## OpenSea Statistics\n\n* **Total Items** - 769.7K\n* **Owners** - 6K\n* **Floor Price** - 0.07 ETH\n* **Volume Traded** - 13.7K ETH\n\nThe collection is currently sold out but can be viewed here on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/parallelalpha).\n\n> *For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe)  and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).*\n\n*We will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) every Friday at 3PM EST.

      "slug": "keeping-defi-decentralized",
      "body": "***We hear the word all the time, but it's uttered so often in the crypto community that it seems to have become just another buzzword. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) purports to have the answer to all our woes and gives us the ability to transact with virtually anyone else without the need for intermediaries. However, is some form of centralization not inevitable, even if we do our utmost to avoid it?***\n\n## The Dream of Financial Freedom\n\nImagine being able to do whatever you want, whenever you want, and never having to worry about the costs. Sounds great, doesn't it? The reason for the existence of Blockchain and crypto is to give people more control over their finances and take ownership of their financial well-being, right? There's little doubt that crypto has fundamentally changed the lives of many different people from all over the world. Whether it's avoiding the negative effects of inflation, using DeFi protocols for yield farming, or creating and selling prized NFTs, regular people are finding new ways to achieve some measure of financial freedom every day.\n\nI say 'some measure' because the ideal of financial freedom is just that: an ideal. While there are certainly ways to become more financially independent or even have greater control over your money, chances are good that nobody is going to pay for you to do whatever you like all day. Of course 'financial freedom' is relative. For the homeless, financial freedom may simply be having enough to eat and getting a good bed for the night while for the average office worker, it may mean the ability to cover expenses while enjoying a few additional benefits. What may seem like a hell to one person may be a paradise to another, and ultimately this lies in the mindset and experiences of the individual in question.\n\nWhy am I talking about this though? What does it have to do with decentralization? Everything in my opinion. A lot of the problems we're facing as a species comes from the centralization of power and leaving important, life-changing decisions in the hands of a select few people who may not have our best interests at heart (or the requisite knowledge for that matter). On the flipside, there's the possibility of total autonomy and independence, with no formal government and total cooperation between participants...Anarchism, if you will. That kinda sounds like crypto to me. In fact, an [article](https://www.libertarianism.org/topics/crypto-anarchism) by Libertarianism.org discusses 'Crypto-Anarchism,' the philosophical belief that technology can assist its proponents in creating communities based on consensus rather than coercion. Now that really does sound like crypto!\n\n![](twitter:walerikus/status/1424685152123375616)\n\n## Trust Issues\n\nWhy do we even have government in the first place? Yeah I get that we need someone to enforce the rules and create standards for society to live by, but do all the decisions have to be put in the hands of a select few? Even this isn't fundamentally problematic, but if there's anything we know about politicians, it's that they're not exactly the most, uh...trustworthy people around. But this is what it boils down to at the end of the day: *trust.*\n\nIn order for a contract to be binding, it has to meet a few criteria. First, it needs to be enforceable. Secondly, it has to be immutable, and finally, created on the principles of fairness and justice. The reason I put 'enforceable' first is because a contract is inherently useless if it cannot actually be carried out as required. And of course, if you can alter the terms of a contract, you nullify the third 'rule.'\n\nSimply expecting people to trust each other is unreasonable and unrealistic. We need certain protections and provisions in place to ensure that expectations are openly specified to prevent any kind of wrongdoing, whether it's intentional or not. And this is exactly why smart contracts are a thing. Simply put, these Blockchain-based programs self-execute when certain conditions are met and facilitate a number of necessary actions automatically. Neat huh?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/38jhIHw.jpg)\n\nWe may not be able to trust each other outright, but a well-coded, properly audited smart contract? Now that's something you can trust! The great thing about programs like smart contracts is that they essentially remove the third party...or perhaps more accurately, they 'supplant' it.\n\n## What Makes Something DeFi?\n\nI think the idea of having 'no intermediaries' is a little too optimistic, or at the very least, it's not entirely correct. It would be better to say that there are no *human* intermediaries since the traditional role of an adviser, consultant, lawyer or broker is effectively replaced with an autonomous code that can carry out their tasks perfectly and in a fraction of the time. I say this, but not all smart contracts are equal by any means, so blindly trusting a piece of software is about as smart as using bleach as mouthwash. This is why it's important to use trusted platforms that audit their smart contracts and provide users with a secure means to process transactions.\n\nAh! But here's the trust problem again, and even if you take seemingly reputable platforms like [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) into account, they are hardly problem-free. Moreover, if there are issues with the platform or Blockchain itself, it can negatively impact the infrastructure hosted on that platform. No human system is devoid of bugs and issues, and to quote Eric Sevareid: \n\n> *'The chief cause of problems is solutions.'*\n\nPrograms and platforms are only really as good as the human beings behind them, and despite the best funding and engineering, some truly impressive projects suffer setbacks from malicious actors and/or unforeseen problems. I mean, how do you address a problem if you aren't aware that it even exists yet? Hopefully you luck out, but the more likely reality is that you only discover the issue once its too late to stop it from happening. Sounds like an average day in a developer's life!\n\n## Manifestations of Centralization\n\nOK, so now consider this. Which platform is the hegemon in the DeFi space? I don't think this will come as a surprise, but check out the following [infographic](https://defiprime.com/ethereum) from defiprime.com:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/y2zUKn9.png)\n\nAt present, the vast majority of DeFi is on Ethereum. While other platforms are working to bridge this disparity, it's clear that they will need to do a lot more work if they want to challenge Ethereum's 'DeFi Monopoly.' The trouble here is that, if DeFi wants to attain some kind of decentralization, it will need to move beyond Ethereum and towards cross-chain functionality and interoperability. Over-reliance on Ethereum could prove disastrous for the DeFi Industry in the long-term. There again, Ethereum is a major contender in the cryptosphere and supported by a wide variety of individuals and institutions, so they can't all be wrong now, can they?\n\n![](twitter:BlueNote13/status/1425181997685694468)\n\nCross-chain interoperability isn't an answer in and of itself either. In fact, if one considers the recent [Poly Network](https://poly.network/) hack that saw attackers exploit a vulnerability within one of their smart contracts, it's clear that some significant flaws still exist. The hack resulted in well over $600 million worth of BSC, ETH and 0xPolygon tokens being rerouted into the hackers' wallets. According to a [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-hackers-stole-613-million-crypto-tokens-poly-network-2021-08-12/) by Gertrude Chavez-dreyfuss and Michelle Price, $260 million worth of tokens have since been returned, but the exact reasons for this are presently unknown.\n\n## The Coveted Attainment of Decentralization\n\nThe main thing to keep in mind is that DeFi is still very much an emerging sector and undergoing significant development. Much like the idea of pure financial freedom, the notion of perfect decentralization seems like a pipe dream, at least at this stage in the game. This is just conjecture, but I imagine 'True' DeFi will have some or all of the following characteristics:\n\n- Free of human intermediaries\n- Facilitated by self-executing smart contracts audited by communities and/or other smart contracts\n- Capable of exchanging virtually any token on almost any Blockchain (interoperability)\n- Highly secure as a result of community efforts and governance\n- Exist independently of developers, institutions and protocols\n- Offer a wide variety of services including yield farming, staking and liquidity mining\n- Include elements of gamification as well as collectible NFTs\n- Highly accessible in terms of UI\n- Can be accessed from virtually any platform anywhere in the world\n\nI'm sure there are those of you who would want to add to or even alter this list, but that's my take on it. I've tried to consider those aspects that are realistic and achievable, but I may have glossed over one or two other important details. I'm sure we'll all find out in due course. We still have a fair way to go with DeFi, but that's just par for the course. That said, there are several platforms and dApps that are really making great progress and paving the way for a more decentralized tomorrow.\n\nIt's pitfalls, challenges and regulations that ultimately inspire innovation and new solutions (and often new problems), but this is the nature of human endeavor. If we don't learn from our past mistakes, we're pretty much doomed to make the same ones over and over again...and we've definitely done plenty of that! If there are going to be any mistakes, I'd rather have new exciting ones than old humdrum ones. Decentralization is a tricky concept to wrap your head around, but each day we're finding ways to make that murky definition just a little bit clearer.",

It's already here, but something is missing— a digital economy to match. Here's why...***\n\n## What is Real? How Do You Define Real?\n\nThere's a theory that we all live in a simulation, but we just don't know it. I recall a popular quote from Elon Musk where he mentioned that the likelihood we live in 'actual' reality is ['one in billions.'](https://www.newyorker.com/books/joshua-rothman/what-are-the-odds-we-are-living-in-a-computer-simulation)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BXj3aYH.jpg)\n\n> Elon said our reality is most likely a simulation. Who's got the cheat code to make Legos turn soft when you step on 'em? Asking for a friend...\n\nWhile this theory is by no means new and has been posited by numerous headscratchers for decades, it burst into the mainstream for my generation with films like *The Matrix* (the title of this section is actually a quote from one of its lead characters, Morpheus). Although jacking into an altered state of existence still seems a ways off, Virtual Reality (VR) technology is already starting to give us a glimpse of what a 'world above a world' is like.\n\nBig tech companies have been lending their attention on-and-off to the Metaverse for years. [Facebook's acquisition of Oculus](https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/21/facebooks-acquisition-of-oculus-closes-now-official/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADDcy_ymGQC5BnSfMUQk5VbOUo5nfceN7Fu47I9hS5MfdI9pQ33ArG-f8zUjbwNVSM1L90fTnoEyjJkUeh94WhNtfpevvmO7eTueWVoMH5loXpqLWIeUCIvC06AlxINqrheHdOxha8pYkx8f4QZZhFr5XXadVR66YrZAHMqxAIPi) and [Microsoft's acquisition of AltspaceVR](https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/03/microsoft-acquires-social-virtual-reality-app-altspacevr/) are big nods towards this trend.\n\nThe Metaverse is not a singular company or application, though. It's an overarching idea and ecosystem consisting of dozens if not hundreds of companies building hardware, software, and thriving communities.\n\n## Toes in the Metaverse Water\n\nBy Christmas 2020, the cabin fever from the Pandemic was real, and I had just heard about the new [Oculus Quest 2](https://www.oculus.com/quest-2/) release. I ended up purchasing two for my wife and myself, and thus our journey into VR began. Yes, I did know that Oculus is owned by Facebook, and I'm not too crazy about that. Still, I tried the device out, and for the price, it's leaps ahead of the rest of the VR industry (which hadn't impressed me thus far in terms of hardware and ease of use).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QM5zfOm.jpg)\n\n> My Oculus Quest 2, with a few added accessories and goodies\n\nWith the Oculus, no PC is required. Despite its compact design, it still has great processing power, optics, responsiveness, and networking capabilities. It was like strapping an XBox to my face and boom! Off to the races!\n\nI quickly filled my spare time with arcade-style games like [Pistol Whip](https://cloudheadgames.com/pistol-whip/), Population One, FitXR, and SUPERHOT.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4RcE8CD.jpg)\n\n> Pistol Whip is amazing— I don't have time to elaborate further, just trust and believe\n\nMy wife, on the other hand, was pretty much interested in only one thing— [AltspaceVR](https://altvr.com), a Metaverse app. Within this platform she could customize her avatar, move freely through the worlds of Altspace in VR, make friends, and even attend events. Since AltspaceVR is not driven by games-within-games, it's closer to *Second Life* than Ready Player One's *Oasis*. As I started using it, I found it to be kind of like VRchat, but without all the 'random chaos.' It's more of a 'mature' vibe, and while avatars are customizable, you can't import a custom waifu with millions of polygons that crash the game.\n\n## Rise to 'Metastardom'\n\nOver time, we both dove deeper and deeper into the AltspaceVR community, and I would say we rose into the higher ranks of popularity in this digital world. People who were already 'Altspace popular' knew us pretty well, and whenever we entered a particular space, people we didn't even know recognized us almost instantly.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PdJtqLs.jpg)\n\n> My wife and I inside AltspaceVR sporting our VR avatars\n\nA lot of that faux-fame was because of a VR talent competition we helped run called *THE SHOW*, executive produced by real-life music mogul *GoldenChild* and co-founded by *GoldenChild* and *SugarShark*. I was the host of the AGT-style show while my wife was on the panel of four judges which included Altspacer *Sasha.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FOcmcnj.jpg)\n\n> *THE SHOW* was no joke— fully customized stage designed by an actual virtual design studio ([Haptix](https://haptixstudio.com/)), searchlights, jumbotrons, a fully functional custom voting system (by Altspacer *Luminosity*), and directed by an industry veteran who directed real-life productions (Altspacer *Marshak*).\n\nAs I recall, the production ran for 10 live shows or so, culminating in a grand finale where talent winners from each individual show competed against one another. There were oftentimes literally hundreds of people on set watching in VR or on their computers. AltspaceVR isn't a very wide community, so those numbers are a pretty big deal.\n\n## ...And Here's the Problem\n\nWith such an awesome production loved by everyone in AltspaceVR, and with so much work having gone into it, we probably all made bank right? **Nope.**\n\nThe current issue with AltspaceVR is, while it is totally free to use, **there are no integrated economics features for event producers.** For platforms like AltspaceVR to succeed in the Metaverse, you need high-quality experiences that people would actually be willing to pay for, especially those that they already pay for IRL— comedy clubs, dance clubs, concerts, even plays...I've attended them all in AltspaceVR, and for the most part, they deliver the same experiences I'm used to in real-life, all without ever leaving the comfort of my own home.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3bhsTSx.jpg)\n\nI attended the *Failed to Render* comedy club in AltspaceVR and laughed many times at many great jokes from comedians, just like in real-life. I could see their virtual heads bobbing and hands moving as they delivered their live performances in a virtual world.\n\nI also attended *The Inner Circle's Psytrance Music Festival* in AltspaceVR. I danced my ass off for hours, Negroni in hand and haptic feedback device strapped to my back. It was just as easy to have a great time and make new friends in a virtual setting as it was IRL, and I skipped the overpriced drinks, long bathroom lines, and pricey Ubers that tarnish the real thing.\n\nI went to a live concert with many musicians performing on their instruments and singing directly into AltspaceVR. There was even a digital picnic blanket for me to chill on at the 'outdoor amphitheatre.'\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/w5BVSmm.png)\n\nI attended an improv comedy night in AltspaceVR and even went on stage to perform improv comedy directly with other people (who may not have even been on the same continent as I was).\n\nI even checked out a fully produced live play with actors, changing sets, music, the whole shebang. In VR, the production team could generate literal magic on stage at near zero cost— I saw things that could not possibly happen in real-life because physics simply prevent them from happening.\n\n**I did it all for free, and event producers suffer hugely for it...**\n\nAltspaceVR relies on voluntary models like *Patreon* and *Venmo* donations, since there is no way to configure entrance fees for digital events or take payments directly within AltspaceVR. The platform is global, so in designing such a system, it brings in a lot of pain points derived from international transaction fees and the like.\n\nI am currently a *Patreon* member giving to one of the AltspaceVR productions. In the past I gave a tip to an event producer that is much larger than I care to mention here. I was genuinely frustrated with the system because it shortchanges event producers. Sadly the real economy doesn't run on 'give what you can.'\n\n## Real vs. Virtual: Same Same?\n\nFor someone who doesn't have extensive experience in the Metaverse (and that may apply to you) the question becomes 'Is it worth it to pay for carbon copies of real experiences?' After six months in AltspaceVR, I can confidently tell you that the answer is a resounding *yes*, and in some cases, I don't even see them as 'copies.'\n\nWhen event producers take their role seriously, the results can be astonishing. Remember that virtual music festival I mentioned earlier? When I took off that headset, I realized I was feeling all the same feelings from attending a real, in-person music festival: adrenaline, joy, satisfaction. I could point at the DJ with my virtual hands, and he pointed right back with his. I was THERE, wherever 'there' was, and then bang, I was still inside my own office. What a trip!\n\nIf I couldn't get into the event unless I paid a cover charge, I would gladly pay it, and probably more than once, too. It's hard to describe the difference between a real event and a VR one to someone who hasn't done both, but I can tell you— even though it's VR, there is, without a doubt, real value there.\n\nI must admit, my story is less about the specific solutions that crypto brings to the Metaverse, and more about the struggles of a Metaverse that lacks an economy to support it. However, it's important to understand the problem here. VR event producers in AltspaceVR work incredibly hard to build something special within the ecosystem. The platform, it seems, is not designed to reward this hard work, since there is no way to run premium paid events.\n\nFor example, when I was a spry youngster in high school, I ran real club nights where 600 real people showed up (and paid a real cover charge). This year in AltspaceVR, I ran a virtual club night at the *Hart of Gold* Club, a virtual space designed by my wife who just so happens to be an interior decorator.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5VaZGh7.jpg)\n\n> My wife at the grand opening of her club, *Hart of Gold.*\n\n600 people _also_ showed up to that, and it went on for five hours with people constantly coming up to the virtual DJ booth saying 'this is the coolest event I've ever been to in Altspace!' And yet, in terms of my wallet? **Bupkis.**\n\n## Crypto for the Win\n\nCryptocurrencies can help address this issue by creating a cyclical economy wherein event producers can earn real money at their events. Moreover, eventgoers can spend money and aspire to be rewarded as event producers. The places where crypto really shines through are in micropayments, international transactions, custody, and the realization of a thriving, self-sustaining ecosystem.\n\nCryptocurrencies allow for micropayments to take place with near-zero fees and can come from anywhere in the world without international fiat transfer costs. Also, in the same way that people retain ownership over property in the real world, they can also own their funds outright in their wallets if they happen to be in the form of crypto.\n\nLastly, in my opinion, it's unlikely that the situation will amount to 'one Metaverse application to rule them all.' The strengths and goals of AltspaceVR differ from (and even complement) those of Rec Room, VRChat, and so on. A platform-agnostic cryptocurrency could easily unite the disparate economies of every Metaverse application. An independent Metaverse Blockchain could even serve to divert some block rewards to a voting pool where users vote for which event producers deserve a portion of newly-created coins.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nI had the pleasure of spending a lot of time with a lot of wonderful people inside AltspaceVR. Unfortunately, I don't find myself with my headset on much these days. I guess I felt as though I was perpetuating the status quo by continuing to participate, and in the end, it just means more hard work for more free events, all to grow the community so AltspaceVR can monetize the entire platform for themselves later. Without a clear path to real-world rewards, I could no longer see the draw for me personally producing events, which is undoubtedly the coolest part of AltspaceVR for me.\n\nI still greatly appreciate every event producer in AltspaceVR working to bring value to it for Altspacers. I especially appreciate the opportunities to speak in VR about ARK.io and MSQ.io at [HiveFest](https://hivefe.st/) and [The Cryptocurrency Generation](http://thecryptogeneration.org/), as well as participate in a crypto game show that was hosted by [Blockchain UniVRse](https://linktr.ee/univrse).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2ucDGk0.png)\n\n> Photo from my ARK and MSQ presentation at HiveFest in Altspace\n\nThese days, I'm interested in learning more about [Somnium Space](https://www.somniumspace.com/), a VR Metaverse platform with Blockchain in its DNA that draws inspiration from both AltspaceVR and VRchat.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/18meYDG.jpg)\n\n> Somnium Space, a Blockchain-fueled VR Metaverse platform\n\nLet's watch the Metaverse industry closely and see how its economy develops. I strongly believe crypto has a place in this exciting new digital world.

Their mission is to help the unbanked gain financial freedom and improve the lives of communities across Africa.***\n\n## Curb That Volatility!\n\nThere are some amazing crypto projects developing in Africa. With rampant inflation, strict financial regulations and corruption abound, it's no wonder Africans are looking for an alternative approach to finance.\n\nSome may argue that cryptoassets are too volatile and unsafe. But when you look at the fluctuating inflation rates in some African countries, using crypto doesn't actually seem so crazy anymore. Just take a look at The South African Rand (ZAR): It has lost over [50% of its value](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/africa-cryptocurrency-market-2020/) against the US Dollar in the last decade. Unfortunately, it's also consistently one of the most volatile fiat currencies around. Imagine trying to save money in a country with such rampant fluctuations. Can't be easy!\n\nOrganizations such as [Paxful](https://paxful.com/) are doing their utmost to affect meaningful change in Africa, offering a practical alternative to those crazy fiat currencies. Today I take an in-depth look at the Paxful Network and their ongoing humanitarian work in Africa.\n\n## What is Paxful?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KnIXlHR.png)\n\nPaxful is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network where people can buy and sell Bitcoin and connects various stakeholders from all over the world. With Paxful, users can transact using over 300 different payment methods including gift cards, cash, cars, and even groceries. Oh, and of course there's the more traditional bank transfer as well, if that's your cup of tea.\n\nAs [Ray Youssef](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ray-youssef-683b20a1/), CEO of Paxful, said in an [interview](https://www.rt.com/shows/keiser-report/515161-nigeria-entrepreneurs-bitcoin-africa/) with Max Keiser in February 2021:\n\n> *'A person in Nigeria can get a relative in California to buy a giftcard and send it to them. They can sell that gift card on Paxful to someone in China for Bitcoin. They can then convert that Bitcoin into Naira (Nigerian fiat currency) and then transfer it to their local bank'*\n\nPaxful was founded in 2015 by Ray Youssef, an Egyptian immigrant who grew up in New York, and [Artur Schaback](https://www.linkedin.com/in/artur-schaback-20b9b720/), an Estonian who moved to New York. The name Paxful comes from the Latin *pax* or peace. The co-founders named the project Paxful because for them, Bitcoin is a way of bringing more peaceful, meaningful solutions to finance.\n\nAs the American economist, professor and columnist Paul Krugman once said:\n\n> *'Fiat money is backed by men with guns'*\n\nThe co-founders met at a Bitcoin Conference and soon realized they shared a common belief. The duo held the view that Bitcoin could be used to help individuals achieve financial freedom and gain the ability to trade unhindered by centralized authorities. The rest, as they say, is history, and Paxful was born out of this belief.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9pVbDXa.jpg)\n\n## Paxful in Action\n\nIn the same interview with Max Keiser, Youssef gave examples of how Paxful is helping people in Nigeria.\n\nPaxful realized that the way to get a toehold in Africa was to crack the Nigerian market. It is notoriously difficult to get money in and out of Nigeria. Also, at the same time Paxful was starting out, Bitcoin was trading in Nigeria between 40 and 60% above average market price. Naturally this made it difficult for ordinary people to buy Bitcoin. Paxful subsequently came up with a novel solution to this dilemma: gift cards. Simply put, Paxful connected Nigerian gift card sellers directly with Chinese gamers. Nigerians soon began selling gift cards for Bitcoin, and so the world's first-ever crypto now had an easy route into Nigeria.\n\nThe [used car business](https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/nigeria-automotive-sector/) in Nigeria is huge and growing steadily year-on-year. According to Youssef, Nigerians are mainly importing used cars from America. They then resell them in Nigeria and make anything from 100 to 400% profit.\n\nA few years ago the Nigerian government stepped in with regulations that made it difficult for Nigerian car dealers to exchange US Dollars for Naira. The car dealers looked for a solution and came up with the idea of trading using Bitcoin. They contacted Paxful for help. Youssef stepped in to show them how to buy the cars legitimately using Paxful and Bitcoin. Their business was restored without the use of banks or financial organizations.\n\nPaxful also helps people in Nigeria make online purchases. In Nigeria, if you own a debit card, online purchases are limited to $100 per month. As a result, Nigerians are making use of Paxful to bypass this annoying regulation.\n\n## Promoting Community Upliftment with Paxful\n\nAs well as giving Nigerians the ability to trade with Bitcoin, Paxful is strongly committed to improving conditions for communities in Africa. Their foundation, [Built With Bitcoin](https://www.builtwithbitcoin.org/), devotes itself to the creation of equitable opportunities by providing clean water, access to quality education, sustainable farming, and humanitarian support. The foundation is funded by a percentage of Paxful's profits as well as donations from individuals and organizations.\n\n### Education\n\nThe foundation opened their first school in Rwanda in 2017. Since then, five more have been built: one in Rwanda, two in Kenya and two in Nigeria. Their ultimate goal is to build 100 schools across Africa.\n\nThe foundation also provides funding for generous scholarships to train female teachers in Afghanistan. As a predominantly Muslim nation, many parents are reluctant to send their daughters to school because the vast majority of teachers are male. Only 25% of Afghan teachers are actually female. The aim is to get more girls in schools so that they can enjoy the many benefits an education brings.\n\n### Clean Water\n\nMany communities in Africa have limited or no access to clean water, an essential part of maintaining hygiene, staying healthy and running sustainable farming operations.\n\nPaxful has introduced a range of solutions in order to provide clean water including filtration units powered by solar energy. These units filter dirty or contaminated water using sand and chlorination, making it suitable for human consumption.\n\nDepending on the topography, Paxful builds sustainable boreholes, underground rain-catchment systems and/or water tower reservoirs to provide clean water to communities.\n   \n### The Olympics\n\nIn July 2021 Paxful donated to [The Friends of Nigerian Basketball Foundation](https://friendsofnigerianbasketball.org//), a Non-Profit Organization (NPO) dedicated to promoting basketball in Nigeria and with the Nigerian diaspora. The donation was to help fund The Nigerian Men's National Basketball Team in their bid to win an Olympic medal.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QiIWTfw.jpg)\n\nPaxful is just one of many interesting projects currently operating within Africa. The continent's large, primarily young population has demonstrated that they are ready to embrace new technologies and ideas. This attitude provides fertile ground for crypto projects to thrive. I know I'll be watching Paxful with great interest and truly hope they continue to go from strength to strength.",

      "body": "***Climate change and crypto are two interesting topics that have made the news a lot in recent times. Today I take a closer look at a Blockchain project that tackles both of these subjects: Sun Exchange. Simply put, the company aids communities by crowdselling solar power cells. People can then lease their cells to organizations in emerging economies and get paid in Bitcoin. It's a win-win situation in my opinion. Read on and you'll see exactly why...***\n\n## A Unique Discovery\n\nBased in South Africa, [Sun Exchange](https://thesunexchange.com/) is the first peer-to-peer (P2P) solar leasing marketplace. I first heard about the company back in 2018. Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert were appointed as advisers to the project and talked about it on the ever-popular [Keiser report](https://www.rt.com/shows/keiser-report/). I was fascinated by the concept and signed up for the Sun Exchange Newsletter that same day. Over the years I have followed their progress with keen interest.\n\nThe [Nhimbe Fresh](https://nhimbefresh.com/) and Sun Exchange project really grabbed my attention because it's the latter's biggest and most ambitious initiative to-date. For this reason I decided to take a deep dive into the project and share my findings with all of you. It's a great example of crypto entrepreneurship that's really helping change peoples' lives. So let's get to it!\n\n### What's Sun Exchange?\n\nFirst of all, let me explain how Sun Exchange works, because it's a truly unique approach that deserves some attention.\n\nSun Exchange identifies schools, businesses and organizations that want to move away from fossil fuels and go solar. Once an entity has been verified as viable and responsible, Sun Exchange runs a crowdsale to sell solar cells (by the seashore?) and raise money for the project.\n\nAnyone from anywhere in the world can sign up to be a Sun Exchange member and buy solar cells. Purchases can be made using a traditional bank transfer, credit card or [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/).\n\nOwners of solar cells receive monthly payments once their cell starts generating electricity. Owners can either get paid in the currency of the country in which the project is based, or they can receive payment in Bitcoin.\n\nSo organizations benefit from getting access to clean, constant power whilst the people who lease their solar cells can earn crypto and feel good about themselves. Isn't that awesome?\n\n### The Brain Behind Sun Exchange\n\nSun Exchange was founded in 2015 by [Abraham Cambridge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abraham-cambridge-6481081a/). Before starting the company, Cambridge ran a business in the UK installing solar panels.\n\nIn 2014 he moved to South Africa and began work as a solar engineering consultant. He was shocked by just how few buildings had solar panels installed despite South Africa being one of the world's sunniest countries. He later discovered that accessing finance to pay for solar projects was a major roadblock to greater uptake. Cambridge was eager to address this problem and help schools, businesses and organizations across Africa access clean and affordable renewable energy.\n\nWith experience in climate change studies, solar panel installation and crypto, it should comes as no surprise that Cambridge is the brains behind Sun Exchange.\n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/9e2Z2NQ.jpg)\n\n## Nhimbe Fresh \n\nFounded in 1996 in Zimbabwe, Nhimbe Fresh is one of Africa's largest producers of fruit and vegetables. The company supplies the world's markets with bluberries, stone fruits and vegetables. There's a good chance that those blueberries you bought at your local supermarket were grown and exported by Nhimbe Fresh.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/246YKzS.jpg)\n\nNhimbe Fresh is more than just a farm. They are also dedicated to helping local communities. At present they provide employment for around 1,500 people in the local area and run several support programs to help local families enjoy a better quality of life.\n\nSmall farms in Africa provide [up to 80%](https://nhimbefresh.com/investing-in-our-community/) of total food production. Sadly they face a host of [difficulties](https://agecon.unl.edu/cornhusker-economics/2018/farmer-support-model-zimbabwe/) including small plots of land, barriers to entry into larger markets and a lack of finances.\n\nNhimbe Fresh takes active steps to help these small farms by providing them with practical support and solutions. One such program is the farmer education project which focuses not just on farming practices, but also healthcare and business procedures.\n\nNhimbe Fresh provides access to export markets for small farms with its outreach program. It collects produce from farms up to 100 km away and allows access to their packing and cold storage facilities. This outreach program allows said farms to earn money and gain access to finance, expand their operations and improve their overall standards of living.\n\nAll Nhimbe Fresh farms have clinics and childcare facilities available for employees. In addition, Nhimbe Fresh supports Marondera Children’s Home where some 200 children receive housing and care on a daily basis. Nhimbe Fresh are currently looking at ways to provide funding to pay for school fees at Marondera and offer students employment post-schooling.\n\nNhimbe Fresh is proud of their efforts to operate transparently as a sustainable business and protect the environment. However, their operation requires a huge amount of electricity for processing machinery, chillers, pumps and lighting. The Zimbabwean electricity supply is 'unpredictable' to say the very least and suffers from frequent power cuts. Nhimbe Fresh is thus forced to use backup diesel generators during power outages. As you can imagine, these generators are unreliable, noisy and very costly to run.\n\n> *The power outages have a major impact on our production and processing, reducing our capacity to 60%. We have backup diesel generators for the packhouses and irrigation, but they’re too expensive to run* - Edwin Moyo, Nhimbe Fresh Chairman\n\nIt's clear that Nhimbe Fresh needs a clean, affordable and reliable power supply to run efficiently. This is where Sun Exchange enters their story...\n\n## Sun Exchange & Nhimbe Fresh\n\nSun Exchange has committed to providing solar panels and battery storage solutions for Nhimbe Fresh over three phases:\n\n- **Phase One** - Solar and battery project to power the packhouse and cold store\n- **Phase Two** - Power water pump sites\n- **Phase Three** - Power for Churchill Farm\n\nThe project will provide 1.9 Megawatts of power and battery storage and is Sun Exchange's biggest initiative thus far, as well as their first outside of South Africa.\n\n![](twitter:TheSunExchange/status/1390243576295174147)\n\nProviding solar power has many benefits, and not just for the environment. Firstly, it will provide Nhimbe Fresh with a continuous, reliable supply of power. The solar project is forecast to reduce their energy costs by more than 60% per year. Moreover, their carbon emissions should decrease by more than one million kilograms per year. That's huge! This is a far cry from running diesel generators and relying on an unpredictable power supply from the ailing national grid.\n\nSun Exchange closed a crowdsale in March 2021 that managed to raise $1.4 million. This will fund phase one of the Nhimbe Fresh project. Further crowdsales will fund phases two and three.\n\n> You can learn more about Nhimbe Fresh and the Sun Exchange crowdsale on the [Sun Exchange YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOYShT81XMw/)\n\n## Progress so Far\n\nAt time of writing, equipment for the first phase of the Nhimbe project is en route. The aim is to have the equipment installed and running by the end of August, so it will be interesting to see if this goal is achieved in the expected time frame.\n\nThe next phase will concentrate on providing clean water to Nhimbe by using solar-generated power to pump water from reservoirs to the facility. Nhimbe uses a huge amount of water to irrigate their crops, so the success of this phase is absolutely critical.\n\nSun Exchange is just one of the many amazing projects coming out of Africa. I hope to bring you more stories about innovative projects in the future, but in the meantime, I'm rooting for Nhimbe Fresh! I hope to bring you updates on this initiative as and when they emerge.",

Let's take a more in-depth look at how this could be achieved and the ways in which it could be put into effect. Check it out!***\n\n## Cheaters as Far as the Eye Can See\n\nHow many times have you been on the verge of a sweet victory in a game, only to be stopped in your tracks by someone landing an impossible shot, or through a wall, or, in some cases, not even looking at you? I imagine you're just like me and find this rather...annoying. Unfortunately, as gaming rises in popularity, so too does the use of hacks and third-party programs that give players anything from an unfair advantage to straight-up God Mode-style cheats. No level of gameplay is immune to this situation either. Even the professional level of eSports has suffered as cheaters still manage to find ways to remain undetected.\n\n![](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zL729kyXcGRWB7k4rPo7tZ-970-80.jpg.webp)\n\n> Ah, how the spectacle has changed from dusty warehouse LAN tournaments of old\n\n## The Fish Rots From the Head...\n\nNow, not all eSports cheats can be classified under the umbrella of aimbots and wallhacks. In 2012, at a [League of Legends](https://leagueoflegends.com/) tournament, the team [Azubu Frost](https://liquipedia.net/leagueoflegends/Azubu_Frost) was caught viewing a screen only meant for the spectators of the event. This allowed them to literally pinpoint where the opposing teams' positions were on the map. Then there's the infamous 'Robodoping' scandal when recently crowned champion [Cameron Jeffers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWNFuWRs3xp-Kj3RWV1ktMw) was caught using a bot to level up stats, allowing him to unlock a top-tier bicycle in the British Cycling eSports Championship. Once discovered, officials quickly disqualified him, canceling his win and slapping him with a fine and 6 month ban.\n\nProbably the biggest scandal came out of the [eXTREMESLAND](https://www.extremesland.com/) tournament in 2018, when *Optic India* player *Forsaken* was caught cheating live at the event. Officials went to review his computer since things didn't seem quite right. Spectators were then treated to a failed attempt by *Forsaken* to delete an aimbot he had installed and saved as the mildly amusing 'word.exe.' *Forsaken* is now credited with destroying the entire eSports sponsorship community in India. Good job mate.\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eQah6ItJUfT2PlNXlqMiWjTwc_w=/0x0:1920x993/920x613/filters:focal(807x344:1113x650):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61854755/Screen_Shot_2018_10_21_at_2.34.15_PM.0.png)\n\n> *Forsaken* attempting to delete the 'word.exe' file while officials move in to review his files. What a loser...\n\nNow, the first instance I mentioned isn't something that Blockchain could necessarily solve since it concerns the layout of the screens at the tournament. But the others? Oh yeah. Blockchain could have totally prevented them from happening. Before we get to that, you first need to understand some basics if you don't already.\n\n## How The Ledger Works\n\nUnlike traditional systems that store information or data in a centralized place, like your computer, Blockchain uses a ledger that records and stores information in a decentralized way. What this means is that all information is stored in sections called nodes, which make up the blocks in a Blockchain. These nodes are constantly being checked and corrected whenever information is added or changed. Once a node has been cross-checked and verified with enough information, a new node is formed by miners. But, if information doesn't match with what other ledgers on any given node have in their records, it is removed or simply does not receive authentication.\n\n![](https://research-assets.cbinsights.com/2020/08/18154024/112017-Blockchain-4-V2-768x427.png)\n\n> A simple way to view a Blockchain Ledger System\n\nIt's pretty easy to see how this would benefit the gaming community. Thinking of adding an aimbot to your source files? Nope, sorry, can't verify! Tweaking minor files to benefit you and you alone? Nope, yet again, I don't think so. Cheaters being able to populate and manipulate the community could quickly become a thing of the past. Now, one of the primary issues with modern gaming is developers wanting to retain ownership or control of what goes on in the game itself. Luckily there are ways that games and developers can integrate systems with Blockchain to prevent these kinds of things from ever happening.\n\n## Tournament Fixes\n\nOne of the first ways I think Blockchain integration can help is by applying it specifically to eSports tournaments. The current system of allowing players to bring their own computers or having complete access to ones provided to them has caused major issues. Yet again, centralized systems have massive flaws in that sense. It doesn't help that tournament standard practices, namely the scanning of files, is still very easy to circumvent. Bringing in third-party hacks while keeping them hidden somewhere in the computer is relatively simple to achieve (unless you're *Forsaken,* of course).\n\nIf decentralized systems were used, no one could alter or add any files and be authenticated for play. Tournaments could host a Local Area Network (LAN) with a Blockchain ledger system that players would have to log in to access. This guarantees that no cheating could occur because only unaltered files can be accepted by the ledger which would consequently be set up and overseen by tournament officials.\n\n## Climbing the Ranks\n\nSimilar to eSports-style play, many popular games include a ladder or ranking system variant. Standard play could be left to the current server hosting format, where nothing would change from what players are used to. However, with ranked or ladder play, integrating a specifically designed Blockchain players must connect to before being able to enter matchmaking would form part of the enhanced system. Imagine playing [APEX Legends](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends) in the Predator League with absolutely no possibility that you could be going up against cheaters. Oh the freedom!\n\n![](https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/ranked-blog/RankedLeaguesDivisions.jpg)\n\n> I think the most I ever made it to was Platinum. Skills, I know...\n\nAs I also mentioned in the previous [article](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/why-popular-games-need-blockchain), one way ladder play would differ from the tournament system is that it could also incorporate governance protocols. These would allow the competitive community to have a voice in how certain aspects of the game should change (or remain the same). I would have no issue having to go through an extra login screen to ensure that I wasn't going to be cheated out of a win by...well, cheaters.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nIf mainstream games are plagued by cheats, hackers, and third-party programs interfering with how developers want a game to be played, there's an answer ready to be implemented, and it's one that everyone is talking about. Seriously developers, you can stay in control while also protecting your player base from people trying to manipulate the system. The only way an *aimbot* gets used, is if **everyone** has one (which actually sounds like it might be fun for a few rounds, but I'll leave that to private server rules).\n\nThe main point is that Blockchain's security is unmatched in the current digital age. Decentralized systems are entering and evolving all aspects of life, and gaming will be no different. Developers don't necessarily need to build games from or for the Blockchain, but they have the opportunity to transfer systems to it. I remain hopeful that, as the popularity of NFTs and crypto-based games grows, mainstream developers won't be far behind.",

      "slug": "hacking-the-defi-ecosystem-part-i",
      "body": "***The recent Poly Network hack is a cogent reminder that there is still much work to be done in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) industry. Hacking is as old as the internet itself (and maybe even older than that) and is set to become an increasing feature as the Web continues to evolve and move towards a new paradigm. What are the implications of this? And what can be done to safeguard against such attacks?***\n\n## The Origins of Cyber Subterfuge\n\nThe media tends to color hackers as faceless types sporting dark gray hoodies who careen through reams and reams of green ones and zeroes at breakneck speeds. Now that's fun and all, but what you might consider the first hackers actually came into being in the 1960s at MIT, or at least a 2002 [Help Net Security article](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2002/04/08/the-history-of-hacking/) by *Spyd3r* (a delightfully 2002 moniker) alleges. Make no mistake: the very first hackers were *brilliant* people who sat for hours practicing coding in [FORTRAN](https://fortran-lang.org/) and several other older languages. Back in the 60s, nobody really paid any mind to hackers, and most people didn't even know what a hacker was. A little while later, [ARPANET](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ARPANET) was developed by the [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) in order to link government offices. Over time, ARPANET evolved into the internet that we know and love today.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QIk6IWK.jpg)\n\n> Without the government, there would be no internet. Now that's a trip!\n\nLater in the 1980s, the term 'Cyberspace' was coined from a 1984 novel called [Neuromancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer) by William Gibson. Hackers were still largely unknown to the public at this time, but infamous groups like the US-based *Legion of Doom* and German *Chaos Computer Club* came into existence and are still regarded as two of the most well-known and respected hacker groups to this very day. The 90s saw hacking evolve and rise to prominence. Hackers engaged in practices like 'cracking' software, 'phreaking' (exploiting phone systems) and of course, 'social engineering' (exploiting human beings and communities).\n\nAs computing power and technology has developed over time, hacking has become evermore complex and difficult to prevent. In a recent [Gulf Business article](https://gulfbusiness.com/the-rising-cost-of-cybercrime-why-businesses-must-invest-in-cybersecurity/) by Gaurav Mohan, he makes it clear that the cost of cybercrime is on the rise and that businesses need to invest in cybersecurity. And let's be honest: the last thing anyone wants is to suffer the effects of a ransomware attack and have all of their data and personal information compromised. As it just so happens, crypto and DeFi platforms will need to make doubly sure that their offerings are ironclad and resistant to attacks. This is no small task though, and you can bet that DeFi protocols will need to focus sharply on security and data integrity if they want to guard against any possible attacks.\n\n## Nothing is Sacred\n\nOK, maybe passphrases, mnemonics, and gains are sacred in crypto, I'm pretty sure of that. But as I've said before, the world of crypto is a lot like the Wild West. While there are numerous reputable projects with great teams and awesome tech, to assume that there aren't any bugs in their systems would be short-sighted. I mean, we can all reasonably assume that our funds are safe and being taken care of, right? I'm sure in most cases users feel certain their cryptoassets are secure and easy to access. However, I don't think anybody can guarantee beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is *zero* chance of something going wrong.\n\nThe thing is, stuff can go awry for a couple of different reasons, and sometimes it's for reasons we didn't even really give any thought or consideration to. In truth, there are those situations where people simply don't know something was amiss until things actually go wrong. Sure, that's totally understandable, but this is crypto. While we may like to kid around, it's serious business and serious money. Before implementing anything for public consumption, it's crucial that tests are performed and analyses carried out to safeguard against any unforeseen eventualities. And if you have any doubts that some vulnerabilities still exist, test, test, and test again...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TO7ONGN.png)\n\nNaturally tests have their limitations as well. Firstly, if they aren't properly designed or don't include all the relevant criteria, it's possible to make some serious oversights. Sadly a lot of issues arise in the most obvious places, and even when teams are made aware of vulnerabilities, they are often slow to address them, or worse, totally apathetic. This is bad news because many DeFi platforms are more or less copy-pasted from existing ones that possess certain vulnerabilities. And as you can imagine, with only a few alterations and some cosmetic treatment separating platforms, these flaws get replicated over and over again, leaving millions or even billions of Dollars worth of tokens exposed to hackers and bad actors.\n\n## Take it Away, Then Give it All Back Again...\n\nOn Tuesday, August 10th, the biggest hack in DeFi history to-date went down. [Poly Network](https://poly.network/), an interoperable cross-chain DeFi platform that allows peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges to take place between different Blockchains, had over $610 million worth of tokens stolen from the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) (formerly Matic) and [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain) platforms. According to reports from various sources, this enormous hack occurred via one of the smart contracts employed by Poly Network that serves to provide high levels of liquidity to streamline token swaps. This particular contract allegedly contained a hidden vulnerability that allowed the keeper address to be modified to one specified by the hacker(s).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/npOraW9.png)\n\nAs a direct result, all of the funds were subsequently diverted into three different wallets (one for each of the three Blockchains). Soon after the hack, [Tether](https://tether.to/) froze about $33 million in stolen USDT, preventing the hacker(s) from dumping a large number of his stolen tokens into Curve.fi, an online liquidity pool. After several attempts to process the transaction, an anonymous user provided a 'tip-off' to the hacker(s), informing them that they had been blacklisted by Tether. The hacker(s) were then able to transfer their funds without the USDT and paid the anonymous user, one 'hanashiro.eth,' about $42,000 in ETH for their trouble. Talk about a payday!\n\n## Introducing 'Mr. White Hat'\n\nNow believe it or not, pretty much all of the funds stolen from Poly Network have since been returned with the exception of the blacklisted Tether. Why is this, you ask? Apparently the thief is in fact a 'white hat' hacker, someone with morals and ethics who simply wanted to make the vulnerability public knowledge. And of course they always intended to return the funds...which is why they stole, uh, $610 million? Does that actually make any sense?\n\nOh, and if a [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-platform-poly-network-rewards-hacker-with-500000-bug-bounty-2021-08-13/) by Alun John and Tom Westbrook is correct, Poly Network attempted to pay 'Mr. White Hat' $500,000 as a 'bug bounty' for finding the vulnerability and safely returning the funds. And as if that isn't enough, Poly Network hopes to continue working with Mr. White Hat to further develop the protocol. According to a more recent [Coinfomania report](https://coinfomania.com/polynetwork-offers-hacker-advisor-position/) by Obike Favour, the hacker(s) actually rejected the $500,000 bounty, stating that it should instead be put towards the technical community who have made significant contributions towards making Blockchains more secure. Despite this, Poly Network is still adamant on paying 'Mr. White Hat' the $500,000 to 'continue his good work' if you will and wishes to appoint him as their Chief Security Adviser. How serendipitous!\n\nSo was the hacker(s) really a 'white hat' all along? Maybe they just had a change of heart (AKA feared the Mafia breaking their legs)? Or is this some kind of elaborate PR stunt by Poly Network to get their name out there? I don't know about you, but the timeline of this entire debacle has been surprizingly, shall we say, well-orchestrated? Maybe I'm wrong, but personally, something about this whole thing stinks. And I'm not the only one who feels this way...\n\n![](twitter:scottwalker99/status/1425268978713350149)\n\n![](twitter:kieran_eth/status/1426914115453210627)\n\nTrust me, that's just a small sample of Tweets and comments espousing the same sentiment. It doesn't really matter whether the Poly Network hack was really an inside job or not. The point is that it exposes the very real problems that exist within the DeFi Industry in that many so-called 'decentralized' and 'secure' platforms are anything but. With these kinds of hijinks, it's really no shock that regulators are seeking ways to bring DeFi platforms in-line and introduce some kind of standard to prevent these kinds of events from occurring. I really want to believe this *wasn't* an inside job, but the cynic in me tells me otherwise.\n\n## Should I Be Afraid?\n\nI don't think so, but I do think anyone taking part in anything crypto-related, especially NFTs and DeFi, needs to make sure they are putting their money in the best protocols and projects available. How do you know what those are? Check out what the community says, look at the project's history, see what their use case is and what they hope to achieve. If the platform sounds shady, it totally is, and if it sounds to good to be true...it probably is!\n\nDeFi is not for everyone, and that's OK. However, if you really are serious about yield farming and liquidity pools, remember that the chances for big gains are huge, but the possibility of some kind of issue occurring cannot be discounted. Yes, hacks are real and set to stay I fear, so be very careful about where you put your capital and question why you're doing it. There's more to life than money...just ask 'Mr. White Hat' and he'll probably tell you the exact same thing.",

      "slug": "el-salvadors-love-affair-with-bitcoin",
      "body": "***El Salvador is the first country in the world to make Bitcoin legal. Will this be the answer to the nation's financial woes? Or will it be a match made in hell? Let's find out more!***\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NuAfM27.png)\n\n## The Beginnings of a Financial Romance\n\nUnless you've been living under a rock for the last while, you must have heard that El Salvador recently passed a bill to make [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) legal tender. In fact, the bill was passed by a large majority, gaining [62 out of 84 possible votes](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/el-salvador-approves-first-law-bitcoin-legal-tender-2021-06-09//) within Congress. Under the new law, which will be implemented in September 2021, Bitcoin must be accepted by firms when offered as payment for goods and services. Tax contributions can also be paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, El Salvador is not getting rid of the US Dollar all together. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele stated:\n\n> *'The use of Bitcoin will be optional, nobody will receive Bitcoin if they don't want it. If someone receives a payment in Bitcoin, they can choose to automatically receive it in Dollars'*\n\nEl Salvador is the first country in the world to make Bitcoin legit. You might be wondering why this is such a big deal for El Salvador as well as several other Central and Latin American countries. Let me explain by first giving you some history on the nation that is El Salvador.\n\nThis small Central American country's past is a troubled one. It has endured political and economic instability with a series of coups, revolts, and a succession of authoritarian rulers. Persistent socioeconomic inequality and civil unrest led to the [Salvadoran Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvadoran_Civil_War) which took place between 1979 and 1992. Due to this constant state of conflict, El Salvador has been ravaged by poverty and gang-related criminality.\n\nTraditionally, El Salvador relied heavily on coffee exports for revenue. However, they later looked to diversify their international exports and the economy by opening up trade and financial links as well as expanding their manufacturing sector. To facilitate trade and attract foreign investment, El Salvador dropped its own currency, the Colon, in 2001 and adopted the US Dollar.\n\nSo what has all of this got to do with Bitcoin? Well, simply put, adopting the US Dollar didn't solve El Salvador's financial problems. The foreign trade that was promised, the high-quality jobs, the foreign investment, the increase in exports...all of this didn't come to pass. So how does El Salvador keep its financial head above water?\n\nForeign remittances is the answer. In 2019, foreign remittances amounted to [$5.65 billion](https://ticotimes.net/2021/01/04/el-salvador-marks-20-years-of-dollarization-with-weak-economic-impulse/), equivalent to 16% of the country's GDP. Many Salvadorans migrate to the United States to find work so they can send money home to their families, and foreign remittances allow them to accomplish this.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CxK2PN7.jpg)\n\nNaturally, this is where Bitcoin comes in. Now as many of you know, sending money through the traditional banking system is slow and expensive, because everyone wants a slice of the pie. Moreover, opening a bank account requires legal documents, like a passport. This is a major issue in developing countries where accessing official documents is typically expensive, time-consuming and complicated.\n\nBank accounts...now that's another problem! According to President Bukele: \n\n> *'Some 70% of people in El Salvador lack access to traditional financial services.'*\n\nSo, with such a large percentage of the population unbanked, Bitcoin could solve a lot of problems by getting money from abroad, quickly and far more affordably.\n\n## Not Quite a Fairytale?\n\nMany arguments have been put forward criticizing El Salvador's decision to make Bitcoin legal tender. The [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Home) and [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home) have outright refused to assist with the roll-out. The World Bank cited that they had problems with the [transparency](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57507386/) of Bitcoin transactions and the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining.\n\nExcuse me? Did they not hear President Bukele say that El Savador will mine Bitcoin using geothermal power from the country's volcanoes?\n\n> More on that in a follow-up article. Stay tuned!\n\nOne common argument is that using Bitcoin is too difficult and risky for the average person. To address this issue, President Bukele has committed to offering training to people and initiatives promoting the use of Bitcoin.\n\nHe is also launching an e-wallet called Chivo, which is Salvadoran slang for 'cool.' As part of the package, people who make use of it will receive $30 in Bitcoin so that adoption is incentivized.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PgSkFU1.png)\n\n[Athena Bitcoin](https://www.athenabitcoin.com/) announced plans to install 1,500 Bitcoin ATMs in El Salvador, targeting places where residents receive remittances from abroad. This should make it easier for people to buy and sell Bitcoin.\n\nPresident Bukele was asked whether the use of Bitcoin would encourage criminal activity and money laundering. This is a common argument often used by opponents of crypto and Blockchain. He replied that criminals are already using the Dollar...\n\n> *'The problem is not the Dollar, it is the criminals.'*\n\nAnother argument is that Bitcoin is highly volatile, which makes it risky. However, with rampant inflation across many Central and Latin American countries, the volatility of Bitcoin doesn't hold a candle to the levels of inflation these nations have endured. For example, Argentina is battling an unsustainable debt load while Venezuela’s economy has shrunk by 75% since 2013. Nice job fiat currencies!\n\nDissenters have often said that Bitcoin transactions are slow and expensive. Slow? I'm not so sure about that. I've personally had to wait longer than 10 days for money to arrive in my bank account from abroad. In my opinion, Bitcoin is definitely the hare while banks are more like the old arthritic tortoise...\n\nAlso, don't forget Jack Mallers' [Strike app](https://strike.me/) and the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/). The Strike app makes it fast and cheap to send and receive small amounts of Bitcoin. This is because Strike is powered by the Lightning Network, a layer 2 protocol that settles transactions 'off-chain' through a growing network of user-hosted channels and nodes. In fact, the Strike app has quickly become the most popular one in El Salvador.\n\n![](twitter:DocumentingBTC/status/1394393371431538695)\n\nExpensive? Start looking at organizations like [Western Union](https://www.westernunion.com/) and [MoneyGram](https://www.westernunion.com/)...the fee system is mind-boggling! Fees differ depending on where you're sending your money, whether you're using a bank transfer or a credit card, or even whether your recipient is receiving the money as cash or into a bank account. Also, one time a relative sent me some money via Western Union, I had to show my passport to prove my identity. So as it stands, the use of personal documentation is necessary to transact in the legacy financial system.\n\n## Making It Together\n\nWhether other Central and Latin American countries follow El Salvador's lead and make Bitcoin legal tender remains to be seen. The reaction of the IMF and The World Bank is certainly something to take into account. Do they really believe Bitcoin is too risky and simply don't want to be associated with it? Or do they see Bitcoin as a threat to the financial status quo and therefore their power and influence? Hmmm...\n\nIn my opinion, anything that shakes up the traditional financial system is only a good thing. Whatver happens, you can be sure that I'll be bringing you all the latest updates on El Salvador and Bitcoin as they occur.

It's not even just an app, it's something that's really intended to have a very big and meaningful impact on how the world works, and so I think just having both of those aspects together definitely made Bitcoin very interesting to both me and my dad._\n\n> _**Q: As I understand it, you didn't have enough money to mine, so you wrote about it instead, and in 2013 you wrote the original whitepaper that became the basis for Ethereum. What was it that sparked that original vision?**_\n>\n> _A: So, I joined the Bitcoin space in early 2011, and I wrote the Ethereum Whitepaper at the end of 2013. That was the time when things first blew up, and it was clear that this was something that's significant...I remember going to the Bitcoin Conference in San Jose, which had about a thousand people in it, and that was when I realized that like, hey, this isn't just a bunch of weirdos who exist on the internet, like, this is real. There's people trying to actually do things, there's people building businesses...a lot of which are actually pretty successful. What started happening then was people started thinking, well, we have Bitcoin, what's next? So what else can you do with Blockchains? Like, what would Bitcoin 2.0 or cryptocurrency 2.0 look like?_\n\nMmkay...so I'm not gonna like, gush over this...but that's actually pretty cool. Particularly the parts about crypto having a meaningful impact and finding a community of like-minded people.\n\nSure, some only care about the money, and there are certainly arguments to be made about gas fees locking out the average person...but it feels good to hear about others seeing the same opportunities and wanting stuff to be better. Even if we can't always pin down exactly what's wrong or even agree on how to go about fixing it, most of us know the world needs to change for the better.\n\n## Growing Pains\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://www.motorbiscuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-congestion-Getty-2.jpg \"Moscow on December 11, 2018 | YURI KADOBNOV/AFP, Getty Images\")\n\n</div>\n\n> _**Q: Ethereum has had some growing pains, whether it is high transaction costs, traffic jams, front running...why do these problems exist?**_\n>\n> _A: Basically, it's a simple supply and demand problem. The only way to solve this is to improve the technology to increase the number of transactions that the system can process. Then there are problems where people are still trying to understand the correct way and the safest way to do things like security auditing...but you know, at the same time, challenges continue to exist and [are] normal in any space when you have usage growing faster than the technology..._\n\nThis is definitely understating the extent of the problems on Ethereum (to say the least), but he's not wrong. It really _does_ come down to the demand for use outpacing the capabilities...any popular chain has issues like these to one extent or another.\n\n> Now if only I could afford the gas for one of those sick [Paralell](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/discovery-of-the-day-parallel) NFTs\n\n## Obsolescence\n\n<div style=\"width: 300px; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://cdn4.vectorstock.com/i/thumb-large/70/88/flat-no-rock-mining-icon-vector-28867088.jpg \"https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/flat-no-rock-mining-icon-vector-28867088\")\n\n</div>\n\n> _**Q: You're planning major upgrades [in the] meantime, and Eth 2.0 is well underway. What will that accomplish? What problems will it solve?**_\n>\n> _A: So, I think what people call 'Eth 2.0' has two big parts. One is the switch to Proof-of-Stake. **There will not be any more mining...** Ethereum's energy consumption will go down by a factor of more than one thousand, and the chain will become more secure; it'll become more efficient. After that is what's called 'the merge,' which is when, basically, the Proof-of-Work chain just stops running, and all of the applications get moved over and continue running inside of the Proof-of-Stake chain._\n\nNow _this_ will be interesting to see. It's a lot of massive, and controversial, changes to one of _the_ biggest networks in crypto. As far as more secure, I have to note that as a bit subjective and yet to be fully proven...there are definitely security trade-offs being made. I _will_ say that.\n\n## A Threat to the Establishment\n\n<div style=\"width: 500px; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://www.deccanherald.com/sites/dh/files/styles/largehorizontal/public/articleimages/2020/10/02/befunky-collage-1-896049-1601615774.jpg \"Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Credit: Reuters\")\n\n</div>\n\n> _**Q: So is the idea that the next Facebook or Twitter would not be owned by Jack Dorsey or Mark Zuckerberg, but be built on the Blockchain and owned by everyone?**_\n>\n> _A: There are multiple projects already trying to do that, and a lot of them are based on Ethereum, so yes._\n\n> _**Q: So then, is Ethereum a threat to established centralized companies and social networks like Facebook, like Twitter, like Google?**_\n>\n> _A: I think it can be a threat, but it can also be an opportunity. I think a lot of these projects want to actually do this right because I think a lot of them are realizing that being a kind of centralized focus of power and having control [over] so much of everyone's data is not just an asset, it can also be a liability as well._\n\nYeah, Ethereum is a threat...but decentralization is a threat to centralization. May it be Ethereum, another project, or ideally some yet-to-be-seen multi-network solution, we're thankfully in a place where we can see a world without giant companies like these. There's still a lot of work to do, but we're getting closer each and every day.\n\n---\n\n**Bonus Content**: [Keeping DeFi Decentralized](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/keeping-defi-decentralized) by [Brynn Huxtable](https://MSQ.io/users/brynn)\n\n---\n\n## Starting from Scratch\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iupNFt26y64c/v0/-1x-1.jpg \"Jack Dorsey - Bitcoin 2021 conference - Miami, Florida. Photographer: Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg\")\n\n</div>\n\n> _**Q: Jack Dorsey recently announced that Square is creating a new business focused on decentralized financial services using Bitcoin. Does it seem like he's building something that sounds a lot like Ethereum?**_\n>\n> _A: I'm skeptical about decentralized finance on top of Bitcoin [because] there's native functionality [on Ethereum] that governs how assets get released. Bitcoin does not have that functionality to the same extent...like, **Jack is going to have to essentially create his own system that enforces those rules**, and [it] will probably be controlled by either Jack or just the participants in the system. It'll end up being something with a much weaker trust model. This is the whole reason why Ethereum started as an independent system in the first place. There's technical limits to your ability to graft new functionality onto a system that's not powerful enough to support that new functionality._\n\nI am **not** tribalistic or an Ethereum loyalist. Bitcoin is unarguably what brought about this new wave of decentralization and is here to stay...but I tend to agree here. The current layer 2 solutions on Bitcoin sacrifice quite a bit about what makes it so great, namely data persistence, decentralization, and security. The Lightning Network, for instance, is an incredible technology that changes the game...but that means relying on more than cryptography, and [I'm not the only one who thinks so](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-lightning-network-vulnerabilities-pressure).\n\nDorsey is undoubtedly facing an uphill battle.\n\n## Into the Metaverse\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://www.pluggedin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/meta.png \"The Metaverse! Say What? - pluggedin.com\")\n\n</div>\n\n> _**Q: Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is also making some big moves behind the metaverse...what do you make of them wading into this decentralized world?**_\n>\n> _A: I think Mark is clearly trying to figure out what the next stage after the internet is [before] Facebook is sort of left in the dust...The metaverse, I guess, happened during the pandemic. We've basically switched from where the physical world was people's primary center of experience to a world where the internet really is the center of people's experiences...the question is just like, what level of quality does that virtual world have?_\n\n> _**Q: So, Ethereum in five years and ten years, where is it?**_\n>\n> _A: I mean hopefully running the metaverse, but I guess we'll see how it goes._\n\nFor any good intentions Zuckerberg may or may not have, I'm fine with Facebook staying out of this. I'm grateful for their substantial contributions to [open-source code](https://github.com/facebook), but that's about it.\n\n---\n\n**Bonus Content**: [I Spent 6 Months Inside the Metaverse...](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/i-spent-6-months-inside-the-metaverse-and-heres-why-it-needs-crypto) by [Justin Renken](https://MSQ.io/users/justin)\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://media0.giphy.com/media/1URYTNvDM2LJoMIdxE/giphy.gif)\n\n</div>\n\nSee? Not what I'd expected going in either.\n\nWhile I wouldn't doubt the creator of Ethereum has a bias towards his own project, there's definitely a strong 'love of the game' aspect here. \n\nI also don't get the impression Vitalik was looking for a fight. He just made some good points worth considering.\n\nMining _is_ less efficient. Jack Dorsey _will_ have lots of work to do. Facebook _is_ too centralized. Bitcoin really _isn't_ positioned to scale in the same ways Ethereum can.\n\nWhile that might be hard for some to hear, the maxi's don't need to descend bearing pitchforks. I don't believe this means there aren't important roles to be played, and I don't think Bitcoin is going away anytime soon. It still has a lot to offer. Just *differently*.\n\nThe fact is that crypto, for better or worse, is still in its infancy, and lots can happen in 5-10 years.

      "name": "Hacking the DeFi Ecosystem (Part II)",
      "slug": "hacking-the-defi-ecosystem-part-ii",
      "body": "***In [Part I](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/hacking-the-defi-ecosystem-part-i) of this journey into the dark underbelly of DeFi hacks, I explored what hacking is, why people do it and discussed the recent Poly Network hack in greater detail. Of course there have been several DeFi hacks in the past, and naturally there are a few methods savvy hackers can use to attack unsuspecting protocols. Let's take a good hard look at the mechanics behind these attacks and find out more about DeFi exploits...***\n\n## Not the First, Definitely Not the Last\n\nThe [Poly Network](https://poly.network/) attack may have been the biggest DeFi hack to-date, but it wasn't the first, and I doubt it will be the last. Yeah, you heard me. We can wish all we want, but hacks and exploits aren't just going to disappear, and certainly not overnight. This is the Wild West of Crypto, 'member? Maybe the worst thing about hacks and exploits is that many, if not all of them, could have been avoided.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GRFh7iI.jpg)\n\n> Not the appropriate meme? Close enough...\n\nObviously none of the hacks could *actually* have been avoided. We know this because they happened, but what I mean is that...if we could take away human greed, apathy, ignorance, avarice, dishonesty, corruption and treachery, we...oh yeah, we'd probably solve just about every problem almost instantly, right? Seems like we just can't trust each other, and that's the problem. But this is exactly why we have security protocols in place to ensure that attacks and exploits are eliminated, or at the very least kept to a bare minimum.\n\n## How Does DeFi Get Hacked?\n\nA recent [Cointelegraph article](https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-do-defi-protocols-get-hacked) by Vladislav Komissarov and Dmitry Mishunin reveals the four primary means by which DeFi platforms get hacked. While the Poly Network hack may be the biggest in DeFi history thus far, as I mentioned, it's not the first one. In fact, if you want to see a complete list of the major DeFi hacks that took place in 2020 alone, you can find them right here in this [CoinGeek article](https://coingeek.com/the-defi-hacks-of-2020/) by Patrick Thompson.\n\nWhile the total amount hacked during 2020 pales in comparison with the Poly Network exploit, the stolen amounts are anything but insignificant. The security of DeFi platforms is an ever-growing concern since the industry has increased in value from a few million to several billion Dollars in recent months. At this rate, the total amount locked into DeFi is only going to increase, and with it, security concerns will continue to mount.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xzCYEhq.jpg)\n\n> Or men, or woman, or women...you get the point\n\nNow what about those four different ways in which DeFi protocols get hacked? Let's break it down and explore each of these in a little more detail right now...\n\n### Third-Party Protocol Misuse/Business Logic Errors\n\nAccording to [Certik](https://www.certik.org/blog/understanding-security-risks-in-defi), DeFi protocols like [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/) and [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) operate independently, meaning no external third-party protocols are involved. However, other projects such as [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/) take user funds and place them into third-party contracts so that yields may be generated. Similarly, some protocols 'borrow' code from existing ones (for example, PancakeSwap references code from Uniswap). In both instances, if the referenced code is vulnerable, it means the borrowing protocol is similarly vulnerable.\n\nA good example of this type of attack is the [Value DeFi](https://valuedefi.io/) exploit that took place on May 8th 2021 and resulted in a total loss of $11 million. Simply put, Value DeFi copied the 'power()' function from 'BancorFormula.sol,' which, as you can guess, comes from the [Bancor](https://bancor.network/) protocol. Unfortunately due to an oversight by the Value DeFi team, while Bancor's system only allowed a certain function to occur in a given way, the opposite was true for Value DeFi. Thus the attacker was able to easily exchange a small number of one token for another by sending a 'crafted payload' to the function, resulting in the loss of $11 million from the Value DeFi protocol. Ouch!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9k1NaFQ.jpg)\n\n> V is for Value? I'm not sure everyone agrees on that\n\nAs Certik explains, these kinds of issues are harder to detect since they are often very nuanced and difficult to identify. Inevitably some things are going to get taken for granted, and that's the real problem with simply duplicating code: what works in one protocol might not translate so well on another. That said, it takes a highly-skilled hacker (or group) to carry out such an attack, which is why this category only accounts for 10 hacks in total which resulted in a total loss of $50 million from June 2020 to June 2021.\n\n### Coding Errors\n\nYup, errors in code account for a substantially higher number of hacks. While smart contracts are typically simple in design, an entirely different approach to development is required. In many cases, developers simply lack the requisite skills to properly code smart contracts and make mistakes that leave thousands of users exposed to a huge amount of risk. Naturally there's the option to submit smart contracts for security audits, but this isn't foolproof either. The work carried out by auditing firms isn't regulated, so there is little or no accountability for any poor work rendered.\n\nAccording to Komissarov and Mishunin, over 100 projects were hacked as a result of coding errors with total losses amounting to $500 million. They say mistakes are costly, but in crypto, it goes way, way beyond that!\n\n### Flash Loans/Price Manipulation\n\nFlash Loans are a great mechanic within DeFi, but unfortunately they can also be used for less than honorable purposes. So in DeFi, these loans have no collateral, but any crypto borrowed needs to be returned within the same transaction. If a borrower cannot return the funds, the transaction gets canceled (or reverted). A flash loan lets any borrowing party gain access to large volumes of crypto that they may use however they see fit. This is generally where the price manipulation part comes in. Here an attacker initially sells a high number of loaned tokens within a transaction. This effectively lowers the price, and a range of actions then occurs at a very low token value before they are bought back.\n\nThere are plenty of examples of this kind of hack, but according to a [CYBAVO article](https://www.cybavo.com/blog/defi-hacks-2021/) detailing the biggest DeFi hacks of 2021 (well, up until May at least) mentions the [Spartan Protocol](https://spartanprotocol.org/) and how it was attacked using 'multiple flash loans,' resulting in the theft of around $30 million. Zoinks! The attacker (or attackers) apparently took out loans using PancakeSwap in order to acquire wrapped BNB tokens. These were then swapped with Spartan's native token (SPARTA) *five times,* effectively manipulating the total value of the assets held within its liquidity pool. The stolen funds were then extracted using two Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes), [1inch](https://app.1inch.io) and [Nerve Finance](https://nerve.fi/). Good think [King Leonidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonidas_I) isn't around anymore...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2KpQuII.png)\n\n> This...is...SPARTA!\n\nThis kind of attack has been employed to exploit over 100 different projects between June 2020 and June 2021 and allegedly accounts for losses around the $1 billion mark.\n\n### Lack of Competent Development\n\nTo err is human, or so they say. I don't think this will come as a surprize, but since certain so-called 'developers' simply want to make money and/or don't know how to identify well-written contracts (or how to implement them securely), they take existing open source code, reappropriate it and copy all of the errors and vulnerabilities within that code into their own platforms. This means that many DeFi protocols have transposed common errors into their own offerings, leaving many participants exposed to huge amounts of risk. This is why development takes time and should never be rushed. Incompetent developers have cost various investors a good deal of money with over 100 projects having been hacked due to human shortcomings.\n\nThe total lost due to these hacks thus far is over $1 billion. Moreover, with existing vulnerabilities, potential losses that may occur in the not-too-distant future exceed the $2 billion mark.\n\n> You can find out more about the different types of DeFi hacks and their attendant security risks via this [Certik article](https://www.certik.org/blog/understanding-security-risks-in-defi)\n\n## But What Does It All Mean?\n\nIt means that it's important to take care and do your due diligence so that you don't end up the victim of some kind of nefarious hack. I understand this is easier said than done, and I know there's no way to *know* that everything will be OK. DeFi may be in its infancy, but there are some protocols working tirelessly to ensure their platforms are watertight, ironclad, efficient and reliable. The caveat? You gotta find them and ultimately decide for yourself.\n\nWhen I first got into crypto, I thought it would be pretty much smooth sailing after my first big win, but that was shortsighted at best. I have had to deal with bad actors, scamsters and centralized exchanges, and at times it's been a real struggle. However, I know better now, so I make better decisions. Have faith my fellow crypto enthusiasts...the show is only just getting started!",

One of my other all-time favorite games that was also created by [Blizzard Entertainment](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/) (you know, before that whole [Activision](https://www.activision.com/home) purchase that totally ruined the company?) is [Starcraft](https://starcraft.com/en-us/) and its successor [Starcraft II](https://starcraft2.com/en-us/).\n\n![](https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/starcraft21-e1563228703949.jpg/BROK/resize/880%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/starcraft21-e1563228703949.jpg)\n\n> Space battles? Alien races? Galactic domination? Bring it on! Hey, this is starting to sound familiar...\n\nI have spent thousands of hours playing *World of Warcraft* and *Starcraft II*, and the one thing I have always hoped for has potentially arrived with *Star Atlas*. When I first heard the concept behind *Star Atlas*, I thought, 'You're telling me someone made an MMO centered around spaceships *and* digital ownership through the use of Blockchain? Pinch me, I must be dreaming!'\n\n*Star Atlas* aims to be the first AAA-quality space-age MMO Metaverse game in the Blockchain space. It seems to have it all: three different factions competing to control the galaxy while battling for precious resources, countless adventures in uncharted space, and of course, no galactic empire would be complete without some good ol' political instability. You can choose to join a faction or even form your own. The craziest part of all is that your actions directly influence the entire Metaverse and course of the game!\n\nOh yeah, and everything you acquire, pillage, secure, and mine can be converted to ***real money***. That may be the craziest part actually. I definitely buried the lead on that one. Anyway, I could theoretically pay my rent from harvesting a star. I can only speculate on payout values at this point, but my personal analysis based on hopes and dreams is that...yes, I want to pay my rent from a Blockchain game. And I want this one to be it.\n\n## Eve DiD iT FiRsT!\n\nYes, yes, I understand those of you who are reading this and are like, 'Well Spizzo, there is actually a giant space game that already exists and has real money assets: [Eve Online](https://www.eveonline.com/).'\n\n![](https://static1.thegamerimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Eve-Online-Molok-1.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&dpr=1.5)\n\n> This ship is worth a whopping $5,000 USD. I may have one and I may not, but it's cooler to keep you guessing.\n\nSorry *Eve*, but NFTs laugh at your 'top-selling $5,000 USD' prices.\n\nImagine that being worth $500,000 USD (which is definitely a possiblity considering the massive boom in the current NFT market). Is *Eve Online* a space age MMO? Yes. Does it give you virtually endless options on what you can do in the game? Yes. Until now, *Eve* has been an uncontested solo act in the world of MMOs as most games in this genre cater to medieval or [J.R.R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien)-style gameplay, not spacefaring sci-fi types.\n\n*Star Atlas* is joining that realm with one massive difference (pun intended...get it? Massive? MMO? Forget it). It has digital ownership built directly into its design, something I personally think is one of the coolest things to come out of the Blockchain space.\n\n![](https://invisioncommunity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eve-online.jpg)\n\n> Eve Online is definitely an awesome but simultaneously unforgiving game. Think [Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/) has a tough learning curve? Buckle up if you plan on playing this beast for the first time...\n\n## What's the Hype All About?\n\nWell the hype seems pretty obvious to me, but what makes *Star Atlas* so special, is it's not just the ships that retain value. It's ***everything***. *Star Atlas* is built on top of the [Solana Network](https://solana.com/) and allows users to create or discover items that can be minted into NFTs. You can also choose to place your ship next to a star and harvest ***actual*** money from it. Be careful though: you never know when the *Spizicus Maximus* might show up and attack your ship. ***Get some***!\n\nThe style and real world value attached to this game open up entire new possibilities regarding how people play it. If I knew I would actually lose a bunch of money for losing a fight, I'd think twice about actually engaging...but it would be fun nonetheless. I imagine factions or alliances will end up forming and even create harvesting divisions where people share profits for protecting mining operations. It actually reminds me a lot of the entire crypto mining community, just with the extra aspect of digital space pirates added to the mix.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1700/1*jVPtjIYDqcSoVOIY70JU4Q.png)\n\n> Where I plan on stashing my bounties. Yes!\n\nOne of the things that also stood out to me when I was first introduced to this incumbent beast is the graphics. For a while now I have found more and more Blockchain games to be a little more on the basic side in the graphics department. *Star Atlas* has opted for a different route, or at least that's the way it seems to me.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wS3UOLR.jpg)\n\n> I mean look at the ship in its 3D glory. Maybe this is actually the S.S. Spizicus Maximus...AHHH so many choices!\n\nRecently *Star Atlas* unveiled an amazingly cool [E3](https://e3expo.com/)-worthy teaser trailer which, after I witnessed it, was left feeling like, 'OK, so when can I play?'\n\n![](youtube:hnFNh-1qLWk)\n\n> Star Atlas' Epic Teaser Trailer\n\nNow, I know there isn't any actual gameplay footage yet...but come on, who watches this and doesn't think it will be cool? *Star Atlas* offers so much more than anything else on the market at the moment. I look forward to being able to play the day it comes out. I might just have to call in sick to work. Who am I kidding? it's research, and I'm ready to learn!\n\nThe only real question is 'When?' as the official launch date, April 24th 2021, came and went with no starship piracy to be seen. I remain hopeful though. As a die-hard fan of *Blizzard Entertainment,* I am pretty used to missed launch dates, and 9 times out of 10, I'd rather have the developers take longer if they need to. It's either that or it'll be [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.cyberpunk.net/za/en/) all over again...",

Whether it's their art, their exciting communities, or the unique features planned for their projects, there is definitely something here that will grab your interest. Today we bring you The Sevens!***\n\n> *Warning:* There are a lot of 7s in this article...see if you can count how many!\n\n## About The Sevens\n\nHot project incomiiiing! [The Sevens](https://thesevensofficial.com/) is a collection of 7,000 algorithmically generated pieces of art containing references to anime, games, memes, movies and pop culture in general. The collection focuses on modern street-wear including shirts, hoodies, headpieces and more.\n\nSo let me summarize the story for you guys...so basically, in 2077, there was a global socioeconomic collapse (uh oh!) But have no fear...it's Blockchain to the rescue! To escape the gut-wrenching physical reality they now face, many turn to the metaverse where there is plenty of time for movies, games, comic books and more. But within this metaverse, immense treasures lie hidden. Many have attempted to find these wondrous prizes, but failed in spite of their best efforts. Now it's all up to the seventh generation, 'The Sevens,' to find these treasures and reclaim control of the physical world. Pretty intense, right?\n\nThe artwork on this project is the coolest I've seen yet (I feel like I say that for every new project I look into, but I can think all of them are the best, right?) This fantastic art collection was drawn by the inimitable [Janz](https://twitter.com/27_janz). I don't know exactly what goes through their head when creating such remarkable work, but what I do know is that their process includes a lot of wine! That's not a joke by the way...just check out their website if you don't believe me!\n\nNow you're probably dying to see some of these unique pieces, yeah? OK, OK, I guess I can show you a couple 😉\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rWK1Hrq.png)\n\n> Wouldn't want to mess with this guy. Just look at that katana he's carrying!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/t7IrPAd.jpg)\n\n> Loving the bucket hat here, flawless fashion taste\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BJD0Xb2.jpg)\n\n> Ah the bear head is so cute! I just want to squish it!\n\n## What's Next for The Sevens?\n\nWhere are you going? No, you can't click-off just yet. I'm not quite finished...\n\nThe Sevens features two roadmaps on their website, namely a Launch roadmap & a Development roadmap. The Launch roadmap includes items like giveaways, [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) added to the community treasury, new art, a treasure hunt and then some.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/S7OMOmf.png)\n\nNow the Development roadmap includes listed items like the project being added to Rarity.tools, The Sevens Shop grand opening, Season 2, an incubation program working with passionate artists and the release of The Sevens DAO & $SEVENS token.\n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/pwaYi7G.png)\n\nWow! Take a step back and breathe in deep. That's a lot to take in, and a whole lot to  get excited about! **Ahhhh!** Can you tell I'm excited!?\n\n## Community\n\nSo let's take a peek at some of the impressive community creations, shall we?\n\n![](twitter:xb5362/status/1430646703091298316?s=20)\n\n> This Cosplay is just hilarious!

      "body": "Welcome to the first Monthly Update for MSQ. As MSQ continues to evolve and expand to a wider audience, we hope to provide you with these updates so you can follow all the major changes, new features, and improvements coming your way. Our team is passionate about enhancing your experience on MSQ in every possible way, so here is a look at what we've been working on since releasing the closed beta version of MSQ.\n\n## Partners and Projects\n\nOne of the major changes we have done to the backend of the platform allows us to onboard partners in a more streamlined way. Users on our backend can now be flagged as \"Partners\" which give them access to the \"Add Project\" button on the homepage where they can quickly and easily setup their project's page. \n\nWe also added a submission form for our future partners that wish to list their project, game, or service on our platform. One of our goals at MSQ is to provide our community with reliable infomration and legitimate projects. By setting up a submission form for projects we also can work closely with our future partners on their future pages, content, and potential new areas for collaboration. \n\n## Monthly Spotlight\n\nWhen we started MSQ we originally had only one Project of the Month. This was a way for us to showcase a project and bring more attention to teams that are working hard within our industry. However, we felt like we could do more. Blockchain covers an extensive range of products, businesses, and services. Therefore we tweaked our homepage to include not only a Project of the Month, but a Collectible of the Month, and a Game of the Month as well. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dNX0nVG.png)\n\nThe amount of new games and collectible NFT projects introduced on a daily basis can be incredibly daunting. We wanted to make sure we were doing our part to highlight some of the major innovative ones within our space. This not only gives us more chances to highlight great projects, but it allows us to work with more people, create interesting content, and grow our community. \n\n## Project Curation and Claiming\n\nFor MSQ to succeed, we need to highlight all projects, even the ones we haven't partnered with or collaborated with as of yet. This is why our team has been hard at work on our Project Curation update. This update allows for us to create pages for reputable projects. Once a page is created by the MSQ team, you will see that the page's Team Member section will have a \"Claim\" option. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZHgONxX.png)\n\nThis option will allow for the verified team behind a project to submit a claim request and have access to their MSQ page. This feature has been tested extensively and is already being used throughout the platform. You'll be happy to learn that this process worked flawlessly and the owner of the project [Dead Freaks](https://MSQ.io/projects/dead-freaks) was able to easily claim his project on MSQ. \n \n## Improvements and Fixes\n\nAside from the larger features being implemented on MSQ, the team has been hard at work adding quality of life improvements that make the platform easier to use. We've been taking in user feedback both from our partners and beta users that have been actively using the platform. \n\nSome of the most notable changes include:\n\n* Adding a submission page so future partners of MSQ can request to add their project to the platform.\n* Image cropping was added for project logos and user profile avatars.\n* Media such as screenshots and images added to project pages are now compressed before being stored.\n* Polygon and Solana were added as Platform options for Project registration.\n* When signing up, the registration form now has real-time validation for usernames. \n* Review avatars and project logos are now clickable and redirect to the user/project pages\n* A user's own review is now shown at the top of the first page, that way you can always find your reviews first when visiting projects that you have reviewed. \n* Disabling 2FA on your account now requires a password confirmation. \n\nBesides the above, there have been various smaller fixes that have improved performance and ease-of-use across the platform.  \n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nThese updates only scratch the surface of what our team has been working on but they are a crucial part of our platform. [As previously announced](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/the-road-ahead-on-msq), we have a whole slate of updates coming soon that focus on adding new hubs, a learning center, and Squares focusing on DeFi, Gaming, & NFTs!\n\nWe would like to give a huge thanks to all of our partners and users that provided feedback during the closed beta. Your feedback has helped us create a better experience and we cannot wait to show you what we have in store. Currently, our team is working on final fixes that will allow us to transition into our Open Beta! We will keep you posted and thank you for being a part of our growing community on MSQ.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n*We hope to share more with you about all the updates we have coming to MSQ soon. For now, feel free to join the conversation on our [Discord](https://www.MSQ.io/discord) and follow us on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/hellomsq).*",

      "body": "***In light of some of the recent unfortunate events in the DeFi space, it's good to remember that there are several great teams building some truly impressive platforms, grinding daily to bring users a more streamlined DeFi experience. Today I take a look at Opdex, the first Decentralized Exchange (DEX) protocols (yes, plural) built on the Stratis Ecosystem. Check it out...***\n\n## Gimme That Good DeFi\n\nSo there are a bunch of DeFi protocols out there in the big wide world, and while they all offer comparable services to end-users, they are not all equal. Some platforms are more secure while others have higher liquidity, and others incorporate elements of gamification and even NFTs. A lot of DeFi infrastructure exists on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/): [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Yearn](https://yearn.finance/), [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/), [Flexa](https://flexa.network/), [Bancor](https://bancor.network/)...the list goes on and on. In fact, if you look at the most popular DeFi protocols on [DeFi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/), I would say a good 97% of these are all based on Ethereum. Now for Eth maxi's, this is great news. However, for critics, it poses something of a problem...\n\nNow before you string me up, this isn't an attack on Ethereum or any network or protocol. This is simply an objective overview of the current state of DeFi, and from the looks of things, it's Ethereum, Ethereum and more Ethereum...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3UMdb6J.png)\n\n> I'm starting to see a pattern emerging...\n\nThere's little doubt that Ethereum is here to stay, but it isn't the be-all and end-all of DeFi, and it wouldn't really be healthy if it was. The reason I say this is that decentralization kinda goes hand-in-hand with *diversity.* And when I say diversity, I mean a diversity of options. While many developers have chosen Ethereum as the platform upon which to build their Decentralized Apps (dApps), others are exploring different avenues. And that's totally OK too.\n\n### OK, So What Are You Saying?\n\nSorry for the run-up, but this brings me to the purpose behind this piece. It's no surprize really, but other platforms also have the capacity to have DeFi apps built on top of them, and arguably some of them are better suited for DeFi than Ethereum, or at least just as good. Now obviously there are other ecosystems like [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain), [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) and [Solana](https://solana.com/) to name but a few, but they're all well-known names that many in the cryptosphere are already familiar with.\n\n***DeFi Spotlight*** articles will give DeFi protocols built on 'lesser-known' chains a chance to showcase their offerings and explain why they've opted for the road less traveled. The truth is that promising projects, regardless of their chosen platform, deserve exposure. To kick off this series, I am proud to share [Opdex](https://www.opdex.com/) with you, a set of Decentralized Exchange protocols built on the [Stratis platform](https://www.stratisplatform.com/).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8sdmYBT.png)\n\n## DeFi in C#\n\nYes, that's the name of my *pièce de résistance* on piano forte. OK, music jokes aside, I'm obviously talking about the C# Programming Language. That's precisely what Opdex's base code is, and I'm sure you can appreciate the simple brilliance of this approach to development. Firstly, C# is known by a huge number of developers, and as a high-level language, it's relatively easy to get to grips with. Moreover, a lot of the more complex aspects of programming are abstracted away, meaning that programmers can focus more time on coding and creating great software for end-users.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EMz1Aps.png)\n\n> No more music jokes, Scout's honor!\n\nAnd the reason why Opdex is coded in C# is due to the platform upon which it is built. Stratis is a project I've personally been following since I started out in crypto in 2017, and it's one I still take great interest in. They offer Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) and 'end-to-end solutions for native C# and .NET blockchain applications.' Stratis uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) as its consensus mechanism, and as of August 20th 2021, 210 Masternodes currently exist within the Stratis Network.\n\n![](twitter:ges3015/status/1428820777856610310)\n\nNow while I love Stratis, the point of this article is to focus specifically on Opdex. I was fortunate enough to snag [Tyler Peña](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylerpena/), the founder of Opdex, for an interview. Check it out!\n\n## Opdex - An Exclusive with Tyler Peña\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BjnxxlA.jpg)\n\n> **Q: Could you provide me with a little background on yourself/your team as well as what motivated you to create Opdex?**\n>\n> A: My name is Tyler Peña and I’m the founder of Opdex Inc. I’ve been a developer for about 10 years now and have always been searching for a new unexplored area to dive into head first. I first heard about Blockchain in its early years but only started paying close attention in early 2017. That’s when I found Stratis and started following the project.\n> \n>When Stratis held a smart contract hackathon, I entered with a project called Cirrus Swap, which was a traditional, order book-style Decentralized Exchange. Cirrus Swap ended up being the winner of that hackathon, and I kept building it out as a side project for about a year.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/g1lao3w.png)\n\n>\n>As I was building out Cirrus Swap, DeFi and AMM (Automated Market Maker)-type DEXes really started to heat up. At that time, I was speaking a lot with the Stratis team, and with a much-needed push, I decided to pivot from the traditional order book-style exchange to an AMM type DeFi protocol.\n>\n> I began researching and planning out the project and quickly realized funding of some kind would be necessary given how fast thing were moving. Luckily, Stratis had been planning its [Decentralized Accelerator](https://www.stratisplatform.com/2021/04/20/stratis-decentralized-accelerator/#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20journey%20that,a%20familiar%20and%20secure%20environment.) program where applications can be placed and Stratis Masternodes can vote to grant community funds to new projects. I created the first proposal which was subsequently voted through, and I immediately started working on the project full-time.\n>\n> Since then we have built an awesome, small, tight-knit team to build out the first version of the protocol. One of my childhood best friends, Steven Lee, is now leading the business operations side while I continue to lead technical decisions. We now work with multiple developers, a UI designer and other advisers that actively engage in the project.\n\n> **Q: What do you think are some of the biggest problems with DeFi right now, and how does Opdex address these problems?**\n>\n>A: I think some of the biggest problems DeFi faces at the moment is transactional gas costs for layer 1 solutions, difficulties for the average user to move and use layer 2 solutions, and in general, the lack of accountability and trustworthiness of new protocols that contain bugs and known vulnerabilities.\n>\n> The first problem, transactional gas costs, is a very big problem for Ethereum blockchain-based transactions. Network congestion creates a bidding war to have transactions successfully mined in a block and can cause ridiculously high fees even for transactions that fail. Imagine having to spend $20 to send an email that has a decent chance of failing. If it fails, you lose your $20, and you have to try again. That is Ethereum in its current state as the industry leader in smart contract-based applications. While improvements can be made in future versions, this problem is still very much an issue today.\n\n![](twitter:ChrisXnw/status/1430979678186086402)\n\n> The second problem helps alleviate the first but is another barrier to entry for the average user. A layer 2 solution can lower transactional gas costs, but at the expense of user experience. A new user entering the crypto market for the first time with fiat would likely use a Centralized Exchange (CEX). From there they’d purchase crypto, send it to a layer 1 solution, then from the layer 1 move it again to a layer 2 solution. This is obviously confusing for new users, and currently, Blockchain-based UI designs in general do not make this a seamless experience for end-users.\n>\n> The third problem is lack of accountability and trustworthiness of some protocols out there. Believe it or not, users will move large amounts of cryptocurrency tokens through untrusted and unaudited exchange protocols. Sometimes this leads to a loss of funds through hacks, bugs, and rug pulls. Non-technical users do not necessarily know what to avoid nor how to validate the integrity of these protocols themselves.\n>\n> Opdex chose to build on Stratis based on multiple reasons, and those reasons all directly help alleviate the above issues. Transaction gas costs remain low due to the scalable nature of Stratis and its sidechains without the need for layer 2 solutions. The sidechain we will deploy the protocols to uses a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism with Masternodes validating the chain. These Masternodes are required to vote on all new smart contracts to be whitelisted, ensuring a public audit takes place and that no intentional malicious contracts are released.\n>\n> In addition to this public audit, Opdex has undergone an extensive audit through [CertiK](https://www.certik.org/) and can be found at: https://www.certik.org/projects/opdex\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ylEtOhK.png)\n\n> **Q: What motivated you to use the Stratis Platform as the basis for Opdex?**\n>\n> A: There are many answers to this question to be frank. Primarily I would say, the tooling and usage of C# to write smart contracts was the main point of attraction. C# is a tried-and-tested language (by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/)) and is widely known by many developers, and there are many tools for it. The other choice was to learn something new, like Solidity for Ethereum Smart Contracts.\n>\n> We really want to build an open source ecosystem that is governed by the community. For this to work as envisioned, it requires developers building on top of the protocol as if it were their own. The use of C# at the core of the project will not only help new developers learn about DeFi and smart contracts, but also allow them to use a lot of the tooling they’re already familiar with. This can drastically increase the adoption rates by developers while also decreasing the frustration of learning new languages, frameworks and tooling.\n\n> **Q: Are there any unique features or functions of Opdex that you'd like people to be aware of (over and above those listed on your site)?**\n>\n> A: Something really cool that we’ve done but not spoken too much about is the ability to deploy new markets with configurable options. There are two types of deployable markets: a staking market with staking and mining capabilities, and a standard market that has configurable permissions and transaction fees.\n> \n> Opening up the ability to be able to deploy separate markets with separate liquidity pools, all within a single Blockchain transaction, is an incredible accomplishment and feature to have. Now, businesses that have use cases for their own markets can work with this existing protocol and not have to build their own solution. Suppose a business wants private liquidity pools where traders and liquidity providers must be whitelisted for exclusive access...these markets can do that. Or if that business wants a 0% transaction fee and to only have whitelisted liquidity pool options to trade from, that is also possible.\n>\n> An example could be a company that makes games all with their own in-game currencies. Users purchase or earn these, let’s call them Gems, but they can never sell them back or transfer them elsewhere to help a friend in need or whatever. These markets allow game creators to use their own market with their own tokens, liquidity pools and fee amounts in their games. This makes tradable in-game currencies, even across games, possible.\n>\n> We want to become a DeFi platform standard that is so easy to use that developers from all sorts of ecosystems can integrate into their projects without ever having to touch a smart contract, and we are really excited about the role this specific feature will play in that goal.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hZTeuG2.png)\n\n> **Q: Does Opdex borrow from any existing protocols, or has it been written from scratch?**\n>\n> A: We’ve done a lot of research on the top DeFi protocols and learned a lot along the way. I'm talking about projects such as Compound, Curve, Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, and so on.\n>\n> The large majority of our protocols are written from scratch without references. The liquidity and mining pool-based smart contracts used references from other projects such as Uniswap. The projects referenced aren’t written in C#, so any references were rewritten and tweaked for the needs of our protocol and for Stratis Smart Contract compatibility.\n\n> **Q: Do you guys have a Roadmap available?**\n>\n> A: Our core focus is finishing the development of the platform and working through other logistics of the project. Currently the protocol is ready and open sourced, and we are working internally and with the Stratis team to wrap up the required development for Testnet and Mainnet releases.\n>\n> Once these releases occur, our focus will shift towards assisting and supporting developers and users in knowledge transfers for building onto the public protocols and making it their own.\n\n> **Q: What are the launch plans for Opdex, and is there any date by which you hope to have the protocol fully released?**\n>\n> A: Our team has been operating an internal development network on a private chain for the past few months. While the protocol is finished, the other layers of the project are nearing completion.\n> \n> Opdex protocols will take advantage of the latest updates to Stratis code bases and smart contract capabilities and is slated to be deployed to their public Testnet very soon. Here it will run indefinitely as a public test environment for users and developers alike.\n>\n> The public Testnet environment will run exclusively for a minimum of 2 months to allow for the initial full liquidity mining cycle to complete. During that time, the community will be encouraged to take a deep dive into the project and prepare for the vote for protocol whitelisting on Mainnet, which is on target prior to the end of 2021.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nI have to say that I'm very intrigued by the Opdex project and will continue to follow its development. There's little doubt in my mind that DeFi has to spread beyond Ethereum if it wants to survive in the long-run. I know I say it almost every article, but we're still in the early days. New protocols will bring solutions to longstanding issues and help introduce the much-needed diversity the DeFi industry needs. I'm against over-reliance on any one protocol, and probably even a handful of protocols. Heck, some oligopolies are even worse than monopolies since there's the ability to collude. Centralization happens when too much power is concentrated in one region, and we don't want any of that. No way!\n\nI'd like to thank Tyler once again for his time and incisive insights and will be sure to talk to him again in the future. There's a whole universe of DeFi coming to life, and I'm sure Opdex will make an excellent addition to it. Until next time!\n\n*Disclaimer: Brynn holds STRAX tokens.

      "slug": "the-scalability-trilemma",
      "body": "***Scaling refers to a system's ability to sustain an increase in bandwidth. Particularly in the case of Blockchain networks, this means supporting a higher transactional throughput as well as a greater number of nodes. So what does this look like? And what are the limitations? How can we even begin to approach a problem like this? Let's find out together as we explore the 'Scalability Trilemma.'***\n\n## Scaling a Distributed Network\n\nLike any network, as capacity goes up, so too does its complexity. This gets much harder when we're talking distributed networks. Fortunately, we can *['stand on the shoulders of giants'](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)* to reach some perspective by looking at **[Brewer's ‘CAP’ Theorem](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem)**.\n\nFirst published as the 'CAP Principle' in 1999, 'Brewer's Theorem' basically states that distributed systems must sacrifice being either '**C**onsistent' or '**A**vailable' in the presence of network '**P**artitions' (CAP).\n\n* **Consistency** - Responses ***are*** guaranteed to be up-to-date *and* accurate, or an error will be returned\n* **Availability** - Responses are ***not*** guaranteed to be up-to-date *or* accurate, but will ***always*** be returned\n* **Partition Tolerance** - Withstanding a network splitting into distinct sub-networks, kinda like 'forking'\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; background-color: white;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/sPwcQ7v/CAP-Theorem-The-Parts.png)\n\n</div>\n\nThis often gets confused as a 'pick two' scenario, when in reality, it's a lot more about choosing between 'Consistency' and 'Availability.'\n\nThat makes a lot of sense when you think about it too. Distributed networks are inherently vulnerable to forking (*partitioning*). And if you've ever had to write penalties in grade school, you'll know every line can be just a little bit different from the next. Even if you thought you were slick by running from top-to-bottom doing each letter at a time, each line would just look different (not that I'd know anything about that 🙄)\n\nNow, you could have taken your time, carefully writing each line (or letter) with a monk-like focus, determined to craft your masterpiece and prove you'd learned your lesson...but that accuracy will have taken more time. Or you could have just flown through it, your pencil transcending space and time, each line (or letter) appearing in the blink of an eye, just wanting to get it over and done with. So what if it's not consistent? At least it got turned in, right?\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/23wT44f/893-C51-B9-16-D4-4597-8-CF5-4-B39-CC33-CC9-E.gif)\n\n</div>\n\nIn either case, you made the choice between getting it done fast or getting it done accurately: available, or consistent. The lines will just be inherently different, even more so as the number of lines goes up, especially if you weren't the only one writing a penalty. Your lines and Tommy's lines can look a lot different, even though you have the exact same penalty and it was totally Tommy's fault to begin with.\n\nIf we apply this to distributed networks, each line is like a node on the network, and in much the same way we chose between getting the penalty done accurately and getting it done fast, we also need to choose between whether our network cares more about consistency or availability.\n\nFor example, travel directions can change for a variety of reasons. Since it's safe to assume most people would prefer *not* to be potentially stranded in the middle of nowhere and eaten by a family of bobcats, our network should prioritize *consistency/accuracy*. On the other hand, we should prioritize *availability* for something like the geolocation of a historical landmark since that shouldn't change...and if it *does*, well, we've got bigger issues to deal with.\n\nSo then, how can we apply all this to Blockchain architecture? It's a distributed network, it's vulnerable to partitioning, and we stopped trusting Tommy after that whole debacle. This leads us to a concept known as the 'Scalability Trilemma.'\n\n## The Trilemma\n\nThe 'Scalability Trilemma,' in many ways, reframes Brewer's Theorem. In it, [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposes that within current Blockchain technologies, there will always be a trade-off between Scalability, Security, and Decentralization when dealing with traditional approaches.\n\n* **Scalability** - Efficiently sustaining an increase in bandwidth, that is, handling more transactions (Brewer's 'Availability')\n* **Security** - Guaranteeing the correctness and integrity of a network, including the ability to resist attacks (Brewer's 'Consistency')\n* **Decentralization** -  The degree of resistance to large centralized actors, who might collude to manipulate data (Brewer's 'Partition Tolerance')\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/x5bwRt2/blockchain-trilemma.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nUnlike 'Brewer's Theorem', this *is* much more of a 'pick two' scenario:\n\n1. Prioritize ***Scalability*** and ***Security***, and we sacrifice ***Decentralization***\n2. Prioritize ***Scalability*** and ***Decentralization***, and we sacrifice ***Security***\n3. Prioritize ***Security*** and ***Decentralization***, and we sacrifice ***Scalability***\n\nOK, but what does this mean?\n\nWe already know that more nodes means more complexity, and since we don't want our assets pulling a ninja vanish, this also means more time spent on validating data.\n\nIf we want less complexity and time, we need to scale back the number of nodes on our network. But wait...that's centralization! Not that way! The other way, *de*centralization. Centralization means trusting a smaller number of nodes, and we don't want to sacrifice security like that. No thank you!\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/5YkYVtg/9-D150842-0-E88-4290-A6-BE-CA6-D60-B50-F03.gif)\n\n</div>\n\nBut then, what do we do? We can have fast *and* accurate transactions, but not without sacrificing decentralization. And if we rely on a smaller number of nodes to gain speed, we have to extend a great deal of trust since there are fewer nodes validating data.\n\nSince we'd *really* prefer to steer away from centralization, and we don't want to sacrifice security, that leaves us with improving the ways that we can scale...but how does that work!?\n\n## A Layered Approach\n\nTo figure out the different ways we can improve scalability, let's take a look at the different architectural layers of a Blockchain. The layering of a Blockchain is roughly analogous to the [OSI Model](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) which abstracts the protocols and concepts of computing or telecommunications systems into distinct layers.\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![Layer 1 vs Layer 2 - thecapital.io](https://i.ibb.co/VtnvsCj/1-j-D2-Wo-Trsrtc-V6-MBIApbq5-Q.png)\n\n</div>\n\nIn Blockchain architecture, Layer-1 (L1) is considered the Base Layer. It's the lowest level where solutions fundamentally change the way the Blockchain works. This usually involves things like increasing the size of a block, decreasing the size of transactions, consensus changes like switching from [PoW](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) to [PoS](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake), or [sharding](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)). This also makes L1 solutions particularly tied to the 'Scalability Trilemma' as L1 *is* the main network itself. We're unavoidably going to make trade-offs here if we want to scale. Remember, we can write our penalty fast or consistently, but not both.\n\nWhat happens when we look at Layer-2 (L2) then? This is where things get interesting. If L1 solutions change the *way* a Blockchain works, L2 solutions change the way you *use* a Blockchain. We no longer *have* to rely solely on using the main chain. That's right, we can offload overhead onto a secondary network which can work a lot differently. All that matters is that the final result ends up on the main chain.\n\n> *If L1 solutions change the *way* a Blockchain works, L2 solutions change the way you *use* a Blockchain.*\n\nTo put it another way, using L2 is kinda like the teacher revealing that they never *technically* said we have to do it all by hand...all they really wanted us to turn in was the same line repeated 50 times...\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/7Qsr2jJ/724-B6-C16-3352-4267-A85-A-D5-E8554-D136-C.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs we've seen, there's a *lot* to consider when it comes to scaling a Blockchain network. There are always trade-offs to be made, but that doesn't mean we can't rethink solutions to a problem. Sometimes a bit of perspective and taking a different approach reveals that our limitations were based on assumptions about the scope of what we *can* do...\n\nAll it takes is a little bit of thinking outside the Blockchain 🥁\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/1bBSGLS/62-BCB496-DAC0-405-A-8-ACB-6-AB5-FB9653-D7.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n---\n\nThe journey doesn't end here! Stay tuned to the [MSQ Blog](https://MSQ.io/blog) where we'll be exploring more technical topics just like this one, including what the different Layer-2 solutions are and how they work.\n\nLet us know if there are particular topics you'd like to learn more about too.

      "slug": "nfts-on-ark-whats-up-with-that-when-and-how",
      "body": "***NFTs continue to burst onto the scene making big headlines, with some NFTs from collections trading for millions of dollars. Since the current industry landscape seems to be lending so much attention to these special tokens, what is ARK's plan for them, and will they come to the ARK Ecosystem? What would that look like? Let's find out.***\n\n## NFTs in the ARK Toolbox\n\nReal talk, let's skip the obligatory 'Wow! NFTs are getting so popular!' paragraph that would have references and links to things like a [million dollar rock drawing](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/264491/20210824/kw-nft-rock-etherrock-1-2-million-jpeg-cartoon-nft.htm). It's time to get right down to tacks comprised of brass (or perhaps brass-plated Zinc, as is the case sometimes).\n\nThere's a lot of potential in the offer that underpins an NFT: a digital asset that is unique, transferable, can't be forged, and offers true ownership to the holder. Since ARK products aim to be a complete toolbox for developers who want to utilize Blockchain tech, it stands to reason developers would want to include NFT creation and management in that toolbox.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EOpNz49.jpg)\n\n> Imagine a toolbox that doesn't have, like, a tape measure in it. That would be pretty weird...\n\nFortunately, the pleasant reality is that **NFTs using ARK technology are already within reach** by using the *NFT Core Monorepository* coupled with the upcoming *ARK Core v3*. This NFT module has been steadily developed and updated in recent months.\n\n## Protokol Takes the Reins\n\nIn Q3 2020, [Protokol](https://protokol.com) soft-launched to serve enterprise clients and develop Blockchain-powered solutions for them. Protokol operates as a subsidiary of the main ARK business entity.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ec9BBUW.jpg)\n\nAlong with serving the specific needs of enterprise clients, part of Protokol's mission is to develop advanced modules that directly plug into ARK Core. Because ARK Core is modular by nature, different external components can combine within a newly deployed ARK-based chain.\n\nProtokol is available to deliver tailored Blockchain solutions to a specific business client, but the generic modules also serve to speed-up deployment of custom solutions.\n\nAs of late May 2020, Protokol has already been hard at work with their initial release of a module dubbed **'nft-core.'**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ntqaD1Y.png)\n\n> The [first release](https://github.com/protokol/nft/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.1) of Protokol's 'nft-core' built for ARK\n\nProtokol has further developed this module over time, and the current release as of July 2021 is version 1.0.0-beta.63.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6gj0n7C.png)\n\n> The [most recent release](https://github.com/protokol/nft/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta.63) of the 'nft-core' module\n\n## NFT Core Monorepository Key Functions\n\nTaking a look at the [readme of this module](https://github.com/protokol/nft) from [Protokol's GitHub](https://github.com/protokol), some of the main features that activate when it is deployed include:\n\n- Creating digital assets based on JSON Schemas\n- Trading digital assets using auction logic\n- Burning digital assets\n- Managing digital asset supply\n- Offering REST API support\n\nLong story short, this monorepository (or *monorepo* if you're cool like that) is a collection of tools, plugins and packages that contains everything a developer would need to **deploy NFT features directly on ARK technology.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/00uVbUk.png)\n\n> A list of available packages in the monorepo\n\n## Wait. What Gives?\n\n'Now, hold the phone,' some of you may be saying. If this ARK NFT module is already here, where are the NFTs on the ARK main chain? If the ARK Public Network cannot house NFTs at this time, does this mean ARK is behind the rest of the industry? These are good questions, and I'll let you decide if the answers are just as good.\n\nIf you're a longtime veteran of the ARK community and our mission to be the Simplest Way to Blockchain, you already know that we designed the main ARK chain to be as simple as possible and free from bloat. The logical conclusion here is that NFTs and other advanced features are reserved for newly-deployed chains within the ARK Ecosystem. These chains would be separate from, but connected to, the ARK Public Network. It's ARK's *multi-chain approach*. We feel it maximizes decentralization and performance, and it also gives projects and communities a higher degree of sovereignty and autonomy.\n\nWhile the main ARK chain serves as the on-and-off ramps to the ecosystem through the ARK coin, **the connected chains would have all the fancy goodies that Blockchain can bring.** There can be chains for specific Blockchain games, chains for digital art platforms, chains for social media platforms, all of which utilize NFTs. It all depends on how developers, companies, and projects decide to use our Blockchain toolbox.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/usUUTXS.png)\n\n> YOU get a Blockchain! And YOU get a Blockchain!\n\nIn short, to see the ARK Public Network absent of any NFTs doesn't make ARK behind on the times, because the APN is *supposed* to be the simple, bloat-free connector to the rest of the ARK Ecosystem (with the ARK coin at the center of it).\n\n## So What's the Plan?\n\nNow that you and I know ARK NFT technology is already here, what's the next step? HTLC SmartBridge and Core v3 are big parts of it, which are already running live on the ARK Development Network (the main chain is currently running Core v2.7.25).\n\nAh, but here's the kicker: the NFT toolkit is optimized for Core v3, since v3 has a much cleaner architecture. Unfortunately, as of right now, Core v3 is still in RC (Release Candidate) status. Soon, it will be fully cleared for release onto the main chain, giving developers the green light to use v3 for their live-production chain deployments.\n\nThe silver lining? **Developers can already play around with deployments of Core v3** and dabble with modules such as nft-core. The readme features an example of how to configure an ARK testnet for NFTs and shows how to set up the development environment.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ikinm4U.png)\n\n> Cool, devs can play around with ARK-based NFTs and Core v3 right now!\n\n**Check the Protokol Documentation for NFTs on ARK,** with [full examples and tutorials](https://docs.protokol.com/nft/).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2QIpKyr.png)\n\n> NFTs on ARK [documentation page](https://docs.protokol.com/nft/) with full tutorials\n\nThis work is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

We want those hands to have the most reliable and efficient tools possible.

      "slug": "get-protocol-is-our-project-of-the-month-september-2021",
      "body": "**MSQ is the new homepage for the decentralized web, and as such, we have plenty of great projects that have already joined us. From Blockchain games and DeFi protocols to NFTs and entire ecosystems, MSQ has it all. Every month we highlight some of the best performing projects and show them some much-deserved love. GET Protocol is a digital Non-Fungible Token (NFT) ticketing platform that has gone from strength to strength over the last few years. We are proud to put them under the spotlight and celebrate their achievement as our Project of the Month!**\n\n## Out With the Old\n\nEvent Management is a massive industry that requires extensive planning and a careful approach to logistics. Traditional ticketing systems give attendees access to a particular venue and sometimes extend premium benefits depending on the grade of ticket they hold. The problem with these systems is that they're often impersonal, inefficient, costly, slow, and don't allow many customizations. In addition, organizers also lose a substantial percentage of their profits to third-party intermediaries.\n\nIn stark contrast, GET Protocol has created a Blockchain-based system that completely reimagines event ticketing.\n\n## The Future of Ticketing\n\nEstablished in 2016, GET Protocol has stuck by its ethos of making Blockchain as hassle-free and easy-to-use as possible. In continuing this vision, they have just launched a new website and content hub, updated DAO-friendly tokenomics, and an exciting new product called *The Digital Twin.*\n\n![](youtube:cjXSeElvbss)\n\n> Check out this informative video explaining GET Protocol\n\n### The Digital Twin\n\n*The Digital Twin* is an extension of GET Protocol’s mission to better serve end-users and clients alike. It allows existing ticketers to greatly benefit from the potential of NFT tickets and Blockchain with none of the difficulties or complexity associated with Blockchain technology.\n\nEvery ticket is integrated with an NFT copy on the Polygon Blockchain, greatly expanding the potential for new and innovative revenue streams and engagement avenues by allowing providers to capture secondary market value and letting attendees collect digital goods.\n\nAccording to GET Protocol, '*The Digital Twin* can be integrated in less than a week and has zero operation risk to existing business operations - meaning existing ticketing companies can give *the Digital Twin* a try to see how NFT tickets can benefit their ticketing and open up new possibilities for their event organizer clients.'\n\n> *The Digital Twin* extends the life cycle of a ticket, packing new utility into each and every one. Gone are the days of tickets being a single-use asset\n\nGET Protocol also announced their launch integrator, [Yourticketprovider.nl](https://yourticketprovider.nl), a Netherlands-based ticketing issuer well-known for looking beyond the QR code and providing over 2 million tickets a year.\n\n### New Website & Content Hub\n\nGET Protocol launched a brand new website to reflect the scale of their broad infrastructure offered to both existing and new ticketing companies. Their *White-Label* product allows new ticketing companies to get up and running from scratch and existing enterprises to benefit from NFT ticketing.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qdpbCWV.png)\n\nTheir new website also breaks down the complexity of GET Protocol, providing a look at their products and the benefits offered. The content hub showcases industry trends and insights from the global ticketing industry, customer stories, and release information, while their revamped documentation is ideal for developers and those seeking to understand the internal systems that comprise GET Protocol.\n\n### Tokenomics\n\nGET Protocol also updated its tokenomics model to provide scalable ticketing solutions to global audiences by allowing all transactional activity to be on-chain, verifiable, and transparent. *Digital Twin* integrators and *White-Label* only need to top up using the ticketing dashboard to take advantage of GET Protocol's infrastructure. This can even be carried out using traditional fiat payment methods where all the complexity of cryptocurrency is handled in the background.\n\n> 'We believe being able to see value flow through GET Protocol is imperative to the end goal of transitioning to a DAO that is governed by ticketing companies, big and small as well as Blockchain community members who hold GET.'\n\nWe are honored to have GET Protocol as a partner on MSQ and congratulate them as our Project of the Month! The number of contributions they have made to the cryptosphere continues to grow, and we have no doubt that they will succeed in totally transforming the way the ticketing industry operates.",

      "body": "***At MSQ we are all about putting a spotlight on projects that innovate and break the mold within the Blockchain industry. One such area that has seen an explosion in recent months is Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) which have given rise to a range of collectibles. But what are people actually buying when they purchase an NFT? In many cases, not that much. This is exactly why we want to highlight an NFT project that features fantastic hand-drawn art, giving real value to its collectors: Dead Freaks. Let’s dive in and find out why they are our Collectible of the Month!***\n\n## What's an NFT?\n\nAn NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger called a Blockchain. That certifies that a digital asset is unique and therefore not interchangeable. Simply put, it's a digital piece of art that may exist as a picture, video, audio track or virtually any other type of digital file. NFTs allow digital artists to claim ownership of their work and benefit directly from their efforts.\n\nNFTs have allowed many talented artists to make a living from their art and truly own the artwork they make. NFTs provide unique and clear proof of ownership and authorship by the artist. This means that any minted piece of artwork will always have the artist listed as the original owner of the digital artwork linked to the NFT.\n\n## Horrifyingly Rare\n\n[Dead Freaks](https://twitter.com/DeadFreaksNFT) are a ghoulish collection of blood-thirsty vampires that roam the Ethereum Blockchain. There's an old story that says the original curse came from a mysterious entity that is also responsible for the curse of Dead Lycans. Owning a Dead Freak grants you access to the Fang Gang, and the more Dead Freaks you own, the higher the membership tier you qualify for.\n\nAll Dead Freaks are hand-drawn and animated by the one and only [cozygrail](https://twitter.com/cozygrail). Each Dead Freak comes with a Commercial Use License, meaning that all owners of Dead Freak NFTs and the original creator have full commercial rights to use the image in any way they like.\n\nThe current collection consists of Dead Freaks (vampires), Lycans and The Coven (which are currently being released). Here's a sample of some of the Dead Freak NFTs:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ce6Nnzj.gif)\n\n> A classic Dead Freak\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2IV5Z4U.gif)\n\n> A Lycan\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4yw2yKZ.gif)\n\n> A Witch from The Coven (from the collection currently being released)\n\n## Join The Fang Gang!\n\nOwning a Dead Freak makes you eligible to join the Fang Gang! \n\nBecoming a member gives you many different perks such as special drops, access to high-resolution files of your Dead Freak, Governance Tokens, a free print from a Dead Collection that you own, free merch items, and a customized Dead Freak. Bear in mind that some of these are only for Elite and MVP members, so you'd better get collecting! Here's some information about the Fang Gang and what members can expect:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TQBP6JB.jpg)\n\nDon't worry, there's still plenty of time to become a Fang Gang member. You can sign up by picking one or more Dead Freaks from their [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/dead-freaks) page. You also have a chance to join the Fang Gang by getting one of their next drops by joining their [Discord](https://discord.gg/GzEJTW64aV) and receiving notifications on when their next collections will drop. A Dead Freaks Gen 2 is currently planned as well.\n\n## Beyond the Grave\n\nAt MSQ we're always on the look-out for fangtastic (see what we did there?) unique projects to showcase, and Dead Freaks is one that certainly stands out from the crowd. Combining the amazing art and strong community spirit, we can't wait to see where the project will go in the future.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tIEgMEo.gif)\n\n**Kudos and congratulations to Dead Freaks for being our Collectible of the Month!**",

      "name": "Ember Sword is our Game of the Month! September 2021",
      "slug": "ember-sword-is-our-game-of-the-month-september-2021",
      "body": "***Here at MSQ, we are always looking to expand our Blockchain-based community and augment its ever-evolving diversity. We currently have a host of dApps, projects and services on our platform, but today we shine the spotlight on a Massive-Multiplayer Online (MMO) game that combines the fun of Role-Playing Games (RPGs) with the digital ownership aspects of Blockchain and NFT-based technology. Modeled without Pay-to-Win mechanics and completely Free-to-Play, we present Ember Sword, a Shining example of how to incorporate Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) into a game. Let's take a closer look at our September 2021 Game of the Month!***\n\n## An MMO Powered by Blockchain\n\n[*Ember Sword*](https://embersword.com/) is a Blockchain MMO created by [*Bright Star Studios*](https://brightstar.studio/). Founded in 2018 by M. Laursen, J. Huijberts, S. Durain, and S. Thorsen, *Bright Star* set out to make a game that put its users first, by giving them the opportunity to own their in-game assets. This represents a fundamental paradigm shift away from traditional gaming business models that put the game's developers first. The added bonus here is that, unlike some Blockchain games that can be cumbersome or confusing to install and play, *Ember Sword* was created with instant playability in mind. The end result is a Blockchain gaming experience that is fluid, intuitive and highly entertaining.\n\n*Ember Sword* is built on the [Polygon Network](https://polygon.technology/), a Layer-2 solution that links multiple Blockchains together, effectively driving the mass adoption of Ethereum. Polygon specializes in creating scalable dApps that focus on performance and user experience, something *Bright Star Studios* took note of. Out of this realization, *Ember Sword* was born. The game also features PIXEL, its native token that serves as the primary unit of exchange within the game's ecosystem.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rlTcwNN.png)\n\nSo, you might be asking yourself, 'Is this really Free-to-Play? Can I really earn items with real world value? What's the catch?' Simply put, there isn't one thanks to the way *Ember Sword* is structured. While the company is centralized for profit, they have chosen to give a lot of value back to their users, and it's this ingenious attitude that has created an entirely sustainable and authentic 'we live and die together' system.\n\n*Ember Sword* derives its profits from transaction fees: every time a player trades, sells or buys items from other players, the fees they incur go towards sustaining the platform. In short, the game receives funding based on the size of the active player population and community. If NFTs have taught us anything in recent months, it's that the more people within an NFT community, the more valuable those NFTs become. With this in mind, it's easy to understand how this is a win-win for both players and the developers behind *Ember Sword*.\n\n## Life on the Moon of Thanabus\n\nLet's get into the game itself: *Ember Sword* is a fantasy-based MMO that features a top-down view not unalike traditional dungeon crawler games. It takes place on the Moon of Thanabus where colors are vivid and pronounced, which is a refreshing shift when compared with the typical dark and dreary aesthetic employed by the majority of RPG games that use a similar top-down format.\n\nA wonderfully unique art concept brings this fantastic world to life which has an oddly appealing simplicity in its visual design. Thanabus is divided up into 4 different nations (Solarwood, Duskeron, Edisau and Sevrend), each consisting of three 'Territories,' namely Kingship, Wilderness, and Outlaw. Each provides its own unique challenges and acts as a sort of leveling guide for players.\n\nKingship is the easiest territory where there is no Player Versus Player (PVP) and significantly weaker mobs to contend with. Wilderness features more challenging mobs and allows PVP, upping the stakes for players who want to test their mettle before moving up. Finally, Outlaw offers a more brutal version of the previous Territories. Stricter punishments are dished out for making fatal mistakes, but naturally, the potential rewards are substantially higher.\n\nPlayers who decide to take up the call and join, choose between three different classes: Melee, Ranged, and Energy. Each class is able to use certain weapon types like Swords, Great Swords, Staffs and Bows. Armor types range from Cloth to Mail, and your class can wear multiple armor types at the same time (that is, if your class is actually able to wear different types of armor). Don't expect full Plate Mail for an Energy-Class Hero.\n\n![](youtube:hYlf_Nheg5Y)\n\n> Check out this early pre-Alpha gameplay footage of *Ember Sword*\n\nPlayers can choose to experience the game in a number of different ways. Are you more focused on completing quests, harvesting materials and just fighting monsters? Or do you want to be the most feared player on Thanabus by slaughtering others in Player-vs-Player active Territories? Or maybe you want to group up and play with your friends or even make some new ones? You will be able to do all this and more in the endlessly entertaining world of *Ember Sword*.\n\n## An Even Playing Field\n\nOne of the things that really sets *Ember Sword* apart is how its developers have integrated traditional time-locked events but chosen to empower its users and NFT community instead of themselves. Time-locked quests and tasks provide special skins or outfits as rewards, and when these events occur, these items may never appear again. We have seen this feature for many years in mainstream gaming as players flock to these time-locked events in their droves. However, in the case of *Ember Sword,* players actually own them. Whenever a player receives an item, it's entirely theirs and theirs alone.\n\nThere is also another aspect to these events: instead of completing tasks to acquire a unique skin, players can choose to search out or even accidentally stumble across a giant monster or creature that has an item only available at that time (or possibly even for that specific encounter). However, from what we've read, you'd better bring some friends along, or you might find yourself eaten in no time.\n\nWe have started to see more Blockchain games incorporating Pay-to-Win elements with NFT or in-game item values restricting new players from joining. This is why it's refreshing to find a game that focuses on an even playing field while promoting Blockchain and NFT-based communities.\n\nMSQ is proud to have *Ember Sword* as part of our growing community. We wish them luck and great success in their mission to create an honest system that seamlessly blends the love of gaming with digital ownership through the use of Blockchain technology. A well-deserved and hearty congratulations to *Ember Sword* for being our September 2021 Game of the Month!\n\nFor more information, head over to the [Ember Sword Profile on MSQ](https://MSQ.io/projects/ember-sword)",

Whether it's their art, their vibrant communities, or the unique features planned for their projects, there is definitely something here that will catch your eye. Today we bring you Rebel Kids Haunted Mansion!***\n\n## About Rebel Kids\n\nWhaddup, we're back with another stellar Discovery of the Day! *Rebel Kids* is a collection of 6,666 (that's pretty evil!) randomly generated NFT characters on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain. Rebels are created from 500 different traits including hairstyles, piercings, headgear, clothing and harness belts. Each Rebel has its own character, mood and soul. One interesting thing about the collection is that, upon purchasing your Rebel Kid, you own the full commercial rights to it!\n\nSo here's the lore in a nutshell: One day you chance upon a weird old-fashioned letter in your backpack. Upon perusal of the text, you discover that you have been invited to a mysterious party at the Haunted Mansion on the Hill! Are you brave enough to venture to such a dreadful place? Ooh it gives me chills just thinking about it!\n\nThe artwork from the collection was created by the exquisitely talented [Ksenia Gavrilyuk](https://twitter.com/KsurrealismA). The collection consists of some spooky 1/1 ghosts found within the forgotten confines of the mansion. Let's take a peak at some of the art below! 👀\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PJGwbul.jpg)\n\n> \"Irene arrived at the creepy mansion to shoot a couple of bloodsuckers. She was a fearless vampire hunter until Julianito whispered a gentle *'Hola señorita'* right in her ear...\"\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3UCZl3I.png)\n\n> Loving the jacket! Impeccable fashion taste\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3yghOXU.png)\n\n> She got that silver cross to safeguard against surreptitious spirits...so smart!\n\n## What's Next for Rebel Kids?\n\nThe *Rebel Kids* team have plenty in store for their community! An official Roadmap provides specific details below, but to summarize, the team plans to release exclusive *Rebel Kids* merch and hold Art and Cosplay contests in the future. In addition, randomly selected *Rebel Kids* owners will receive a unique Twitter banner to the kid they own. New collections are also in the works as well as a haunted mansion in a Sandbox-style game where exclusive parties and exhibitions will take place. That's freakishly phenomenal!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sMADlHj.png)\n\n## Mint Your Own Rebel Kid\n\n* **Total Items** - 6,666\n* **Mint Price** - 0.06 ETH\n\nYou can mint your own *Rebel Kid* [here](https://rebelkidsparade.com/#/), or you can view the collection here on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/rebel-kids).\n\n> For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) on SubStack, and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar).\n\n*We will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) every Friday at 3PM EST.

      "name": "Preview: The Six Dragons (Beta)",
      "slug": "preview-the-six-dragons-beta",
      "body": "***From the creation of legendary book series and tabletop games to much beloved video games like [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/) and [Skyrim](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/), the fantasy genre just seems to stir something deep within each and every one of us. For years people have shown great interest in Role-Playing Games (RPGs). A little while ago I heard of a game bringing fantasy to the world of Blockchain, so I decided to check it out. So let's brew our potions, ready our spells, and equip our armor: Here comes [The Six Dragons](https://thesixdragons.com/).***\n\n## Good Morrow Brave Traveler\n\nI **love** fantasy. Plain and simple. I first encountered fantasy, like most people my age, when I decided to read *The Hobbit*, a novel by South African author *J.R.R.Tolkien* that gave the world a blueprint for modern fantasy all the way back in 1937. Tolkien further expanded this world with the *Lord of the Rings* Trilogy, starting with *The Fellowship of the Ring* in 1954.\n\nFast forward a few years later, and [Dungeons and Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/) (or D&D), introduced a new aspect to that blueprint, paving the way for people to immerse themselves in these fantastical worlds using RPG elements.\n\n![](https://images.prismic.io/userzoom/31015a32-d346-4ac3-8ae5-10ebc5f2b645_116578.jpg?auto=compress,format&w=1800)\n\n>The OG of RPGs. All hail the King!\n\nLet's look at the template D&D created and what every modern RPG is based on. D&D is considered by many to be the first commercial RPG, allowing people to **become** those characters they loved so much from fantasy books. Night after night, you can still find friends huddled around tables with dice, spending countless hours building characters and weaving all-new narratives. Adding to this fun is the fact that players can continue adventures by saving statistics on ledger-style  'Character Cards.'\n\nGuided and governed by a 'Game Master' or GM, the person who enforces the rules and determines the storyline of the adventure, friends quest together using  dice to determine every decision the party makes as well as their ultimate fate. Want to kill that goblin? Distract it? Or maybe you're weird like me and want to try befriend it? You can choose any of these options, or literally anything you can dream up. You just better get a good roll, regardless of what you choose.\n\nI myself used to play a dumbed-down version of D&D with an old friend of mine. He always took on the role of GM, but my trusty Elf Rogue kept me out of harms way, usually. I may or may not have died a few times, but that's beside the point. I absolutely loved the RPG element of the whole experience, and I have been playing RPGs ever since.\n\n![](https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/middle-earth-shadows-of-mordor-header.jpg)\n\n> My wife loved [The Shadow of Mordor](https://www.shadowofwar.com/shadow-of-mordor/), an RPG that takes place in Tolkien's *Middle Earth*. I never got around to playing it, but it looks fun as hell...\n\n## Fantasy Meets Blockchain\n\n*The Six Dragons* is the first of its kind: a fantasy-based RPG with digital ownership at its core built on [Enjin](https://enjin.io/), it integrates all the security of Blockchain with the added bonus of NFT-based items and an internal marketplace option for in-game assets. \n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/3310/1*h1yur0ehQpVhYhzB_EQcZw.png)\n\n> Described as *Skyrim* for Blockchain, you *know* I downloaded this\n\nNow, I didn't have a ton of time to play this game, but I was able to identify and test out some of the Blockchain elements. A good example of this is the marketplace that easily allows you to sell, buy, or trade items that hold real world value. Games like *World of Warcraft* will actually ban you if you're caught selling items for real money. Move over [Blizzard](https://www.blizzard.com/), a new way of doing things is here.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0jJMQst.png)\n\n> Are you going to buy, sell or trade? It's actually pretty easy\n\nAnother aspect I enjoyed was the crafting station, which allows you to use recipes you find from enemies you've killed. When combined with the required materials, you can create a unique weapon, armor piece or just higher tier items. You should know that, before you're able to enter the crafting menu, you are given the choice of doing Off-Chain or Blockchain crafting. Each require you to go through an authentication process before continuing.\n\nIs it a little slow? Sure, but it's almost impossible to cheat or dupe. And yes, tons of games have crafting like this, but what they don't have is Blockchain. You own those items and materials, and you can sell them, or at least attempt to sell them for whatever price you want. Not to repeat myself from past articles, but gaming and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) or digital ownership-based systems are **made** for each other when done right.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ga7VXrV.png)\n\n> Let's forge some awesomeness. Is that a word? It doesn't matter! *I own it!*\n\n## Onward to the Dragons...Maybe?\n\nNow, being a fantasy lover, RPG addict, and Blockchain enthusiast, I had to try this game out. And it was here I encountered my first challenge: *installing the game*.\n\nThe website had a convenient button proclaiming 'Play Now,' which upon clicking, started a download for a RAR file. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, except VLC player really wanted to run that file, as well as 3 other programs, none of which actually had the ability to do so!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PhNRhX6.png)\n\n> *I just want to Quest!*\n\nI then turned to Google, and was directed to [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/). At first I thought, 'Perfect, *Steam* will facilitate everything I need to do with prompts, making this a very easy installation.' So I loaded up *Steam*, searched for *The Six Dragons*, and found it immediately. But when I went to click download, I realized that...nothing was there. No download option.\n\nOkay, so how do I play this game? Not too long after this I was fortunate enough to find an article saying I needed to use [Winzip](https://www.winzip.com/) to extract the folder from the RAR file, which the website mentioned nothing of. Okay, so I will say, I did find the answer in the FAQ section after directly searching for my issue, but why not have some installation instructions if it's going to be like this?\n\nAnyway, whatever. I finally saw the launcher icon in the folder, and so finally, it was time to play. Oh no wait, sorry...it's actually time to install. I literally forgot I hadn't even installed the game yet! This better be good. Glass-half full Spizzo, at least its installing...\n\nWhile installing I started doing some other stuff on my computer. Then suddenly, without telling it to execute, my journey into the *The Six Dragons* began. Taking over my screen, I was thrust into a cinematic intro with fire exploding out of the title text. Here we go!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TGpIScm.png)\n\n> It's pretty awesome...who doesn't love explosions? I particularly enjoy the embers afterwards \n\nI was then greeted with the almighty login screen. Perfect. Time to start slaying, questing, dominating, and my journey to become the megalomaniac who rules over this new world of Blockchain RPGs. Too much? Sorry, I plan to be drunk on power ASAP. Anyway, I assigned my username and email and was told to simply login to let the questing begin, so I clicked the login...game-time baby.\n\nOh man, not gaming time yet. I was instructed to download an *Enjin* app and register it, and only once that was complete, scan a QR code to link my game account with my wallet. Can I just play this game? Don't get me wrong, I understand I need to assign a wallet (I mean, it's Blockchain life after all) and that the game is powered by *Enjin*, hence the app, but Good Lord, you'd think there would be **some** information from the website after the 'Play Now' button, telling you about what you should expect with the install and how to do it. ***Something!***\n\nThis is the second time I would have liked a heads-up from the website that I don't have to search for myself. Granted, 'Let's make lemonade out of this situation,' I thought. 'At least I'm finally ready to rock and roll...I hope.' I closed my eyes and clicked the login button. Thankfully, it was *finally* time to start my journey into the world of *The Six Dragons*...\n\n![](https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/749950/ss_ab48ea6f4956b3076e4cbdcd61c19b31c3d89ae2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1606416377)\n\n> Epic quests await. This Heads-Up Display (HUD) is extremely familiar to me thanks to years of playing [Diablo](https://us.diablo3.com/)\n\n## Direct Me to the Nearest Castle Good Sir!\n\nMy epic quest had finally started. Spirits were high, as well as expectations. I was dropped into a green field, and to my left were rocks forming into a mountain. I was alone, naked, and afraid. Well technically I was wearing underwear. Regardless, I wasn't exactly ready to take anything on, let alone dominate the world. A series of messages on the screen popped up, telling me to equip items my character had in his inventory. I quickly pressed the standard hotkey (I), and my 'nude' character appeared in an inventory menu.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iRgZSaG.png)\n\n> Diapers? Maybe. Knighthood? Unlikely. Excitement? Maximum!\n\nAfter equipping my self-proclaimed *Mace of Death*, and *Cloth Armor of the Awesome People*, I took my first steps into the world. Almost instantly I was engaged by a very rude Level 1 Skeleton, who foolishly thought he could contend with my raw Level 1 power.\n\nWhatever, I easily dispatched my foe, only to be charged at by a Level 3 Spider. Hesitant, I pressed on to engage, and yet again, I prevailed. 'I got this,' I thought, and pushed onward into the unknown. Every hill or tree I passed, a new foe came charging right at me.\n\nOne thing to note is that enemies can apparently travel through rocks. I, on the other hand...cannot. Skeletons and spiders populated the area and were clearly my mortal enemies.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/l3jT1dn.png)\n\n> Bring it on you no-meat-having fool! *I. Will. Crush. You!*\n\nWhile killing everything I came into contact with, I felt something was off. Then, it hit me. There was no music to accompany me on my quest. Sure, there were sounds, but zero music. The title screen had music, but the game...didn't? After realizing it, when I wasn't fighting something, the game felt empty. I'd even take some loop of generic free rights renaissance songs at this point. You know the ones. I shrugged it off, focused myself, and tried to figure out some sort of goal since I wasn't assigned any Quests. Maybe one of those pop-ups I skipped said what to do? But if it did, shouldn't it show up as a Quest?\n\nUndeterred, I looked to my minimap. Multiple icons were visible, so naturally I headed for the nearest one. A town presumably? No. A portal I couldn't access...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GxcbqaU.png)\n\n> Screw you portals. I can't access any of you\n\nNo worries, onto the next icon. After vanquishing my foes on the way, I reached uh, another portal that I...also couldn't access. I looked closer at the icons on the map and saw a money symbol. That had to be a merchant, and where there are merchants, there are towns and safety. So onward I marched.\n\n## Can I Get a Discount?\n\nAfter nearly dying two different times when I was attacked by three enemies at once, one of which was level 4, impressive, I know. I traversed over a hill and saw the goal in the distance. A series of small buildings, with fenced in farmland in between them. I finally made it to town. Time to upgrade.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NEIP4tr.png)\n\n> I paid my dues, and ground my way into town. Honestly, it wasn't very difficult\n\nI spoke with the first person I encountered, someone pretending to be cooler than me...a merchant. The nerve of this guy! He thinks he can buy things for almost nothing while charging me 10 times what he paid? Typical. Not today friend. On to the next vendor...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7Ncq9Jz.png)\n\n> There he is, the extortionist, I mean merchant\n\nI moved onto the rest the of town, seeing what others had to offer. Unfortunately, I quickly realized that the first merchant I talked to was the only one in town for buying base items. You win this round buddy!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5AP7bCT.png)\n\n> I'm sorry, how much did you say that Scroll was!?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1iJnrug.png)\n\n> Gimme some new gear!\n\nNaturally, I couldn't afford the new armor, even after selling the items I collected. Apparently the game was going to make me earn the armor, so I headed back into the world to collect more gold from my old foes: skeletons and spiders.\n\nAfter a little while, I acquired the necessary gold and headed back to town to buy some new gear, and by new gear I mean a pair of bracers. Don't hate. I was also pretty disappointed it didn't change my appearance, but I could feel my power growing.\n\nWhile my time was brief, my Quest is far from over. I will control all 256,000/m² in *The Six Dragons*. You'll see! Oh, and yeah, the game actually has that much space...for now.\n\n## So What's the Verdict?\n\nI wouldn't say the *The Six Dragons* is a polished game in any way, shape, or form. With generally rough graphics compared to what players are used to, empty feeling worlds due to the lack of music, slow authentication times that make you think your game is frozen during crafting, an overall lack of visual complexity, and of course, the totally informative and easy-to-figure-out installation process (not), there is still a lot of room for improvement which is to be expected as it is still in it's beta stage.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the game is still in Beta and therefore has a lot of potential in my opinion. I definitely enjoyed my time playing and will continue to do so. If you love basic mechanics of fantasy RPGs as well as Blockchain and aren't put off by something being rough around the edges, I'd say give *The Six Dragons* a shot.\n\nHopefully the developers will continue to improve the experience while maintaining the overall vibe they have created, as I am and will continue to be a fan. I wish you luck and hope you have fun on your future adventures in *The Six Dragons*. Just don't get in my way...\n\n## Summary\n\n*The Six Dragons* definitely gets kudos for being entirely **free** and that the Beta is available to everyone. Some Blockchain games require large sums of money to be able to play, and luckily, this is not one of them. The biggest issue it currently has is the lack of direction for new users to easily install this game. You're in luck though. If you want to play *The Six Dragons*, I've compiled a set of step-by-step instructions so you can start your Quest ASAP and sidestep this one unfortunate aspect. Happy Hunting!\n\n### Installation Guide\n\n- Go to [The Six Dragons](https://thesixdragons.com/) website\n- Click 'Play Now'\n- You should see a RAR file download begin\n- Make sure you have [Winzip](https://www.winzip.com/)\n- Use ***Winzip*** to extract the RAR file\n- Open the Extracted file and click the launcher to start installation\n- Once installed, start the game\n- At the login screen, create a new account\n- The game should direct you to the [Enjin App](https://enjin.io/) via email\n- Create an account on the ***Enjin App***\n- Use the ***Enjin App*** to scan the QR code provided to you by ***The Six Dragons*** login process, and it will automatically pair the app with your *Six Dragons* account\n- Log back into ***The Six Dragons***, and you're now questing!\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nThe Gameplay, overall concept and replayability of *The Six Dragons* are what make it really worthwhile. If this is what it looks like in Beta, I'm sure the Official Release is gonna be awesome. Would be great to hear some music for a little more atmosphere, and a little more guidance on installation for new players. Other than those minor issues, *The Six Dragons* is very promising and I'll be sure to check it out when it launches. Those spiders and skeletons don't stand a chance!",

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seems to be stepping up their efforts to regulate the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Industry and has even gone as far as entering into a partnership with a Blockchain Analytics Firm. Does this spell Doom for DeFi? Or is it just another ham-fisted attempt by authorities to put a muzzle on Blockchain?***\n\n## 'War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength'\n\nFor those of you who don't know, [George Orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell)'s prescient novel [Nineteen Eighty Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) was written several decades ago and first published on June 8th 1949, about four years after the end of World War II. The narrative outlines a dystopian world in which surveillance, subservience and suppression are the order of the day. Individual behavior and critical thought are violently discouraged, and what constitutes 'The Truth' is horribly (and deliberately) convoluted to say the very least. Winston Smith, the novel's protagonist, despises 'The Party' and their tyrannical *Thought Police* and dreams of breaking free from the chains of the stifling world in which he finds himself.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FvaTVhv.png)\n\n> The cover of the first edition of Orwell's *Nineteen Eighty Four*\n\nDespite being several decades old, Orwell's novel is still regarded as one of the greatest written in the past century, and possibly ever. This is because the Indian-born writer based the totalitarian world of *Nineteen Eighty Four* on Soviet Russia under [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin) and Nazi Germany under [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler). In other words, *Nineteen Eighty Four* is only fictional insomuch as its characters and course of events, but the attitudes, ideologies and values reflected therein are very much part of our modern reality.\n\nAnd if you look at our world today, it's populated by all kinds of organizations that serve to 'safeguard' and 'protect' us from our own thoughts, interests and behaviors. Social media sites like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) are quick to deplatform anyone deemed guilty of *wrongthink* (a term coined by Orwell in *Nineteen Eighty Four*) and punish any dissenters in increasingly bizarre and invasive ways (such as sending users messages for engaging with certain kinds of content or using words that are 'troublesome'). Whether we like it or not, our activity is monitored, recorded and even used to manipulate our behavior.\n\nThis is reminiscent of [Philip K. Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick)'s 1977 novel [A Scanner Darkly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Scanner_Darkly) in which a large portion of society is addicted to a drug known as 'Substance D' and citizens are constantly monitored by 'holo scanners.'\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UU7QLof.jpg)\n\n> The 2006 cinematic version of *A Scanner Darkly* employs interpolated rotoscoping which, when combined with live camera footage, results in an animated aesthetic\n\n## The SEC's Eye of Providence\n\nOn August 12th 1986, former US President [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan) said:\n\n> The nine most terrifying words in the English language are 'I'm from the Government, and I'm here to help.'\n\nThose words probably ring in the ears of crypto and DeFi enthusiasts like the aftershock of a shotgun shell in an empty cellar. And the resulting tinnitus doesn't ever seem to dissipate either. Government agencies exist in order to protect us from various threats, and there's no bigger threat in this universe than your own damn decisions citizen! *Put down the smartphone and stop trading sir! DeFi is risky and you could lose all your funds!* says the officer as he draws his taser with both hands. Now, unless you were born yesterday, it's no secret that there are risks in DeFi and that anything that goes wrong is pretty much your problem and your problem alone (at least this stage).\n\nBut have no fear! The SEC is here to make sure that you are abundantly aware of the risks associated with DeFi trading, but moreover, that they are able to keep tabs on DeFi transactions in a much more 'intimate' way. Lacking the technical knowledge and know-how of the space themselves (surprise surprise!), the SEC has called on the assistance of Blockchain Analytics Firm AnChain.AI. According to [The Daily Hodl](https://dailyhodl.com/2021/08/28/sec-inks-deal-with-blockchain-analytics-firm-to-monitor-defi-transactions/), AnChain has entered into a deal with the SEC so that they can better understand and regulate the world of DeFi. And as we know, regulation is *always* a bad thing...or is it?\n\n![](youtube:nfbBm0-MHTY)\n\n> A brief video outlining AnChain.AI and their forensics platform\n\nNow I don't know about you, but this doesn't exactly scream surveillance and spying to me. I'm not entirely sure the SEC is looking to track every transaction or punish people using crypto and DeFi across the board. I'm also not saying their intentions are entirely 'honorable,' and while it's good to be wary of anyone from a government institution, it's also foolish to assume they're going to do their utmost to scuttle an entire industry worth billions of dollars. Having said this, there's no doubt that the SEC is looking to protect their interests as well as the interests of other entities. What exactly this entails I can only guess, but it is something of a concern. As for AnChain's decision to work with the SEC? Well, let's just say most people seem to think they're, uh...traitors.\n\n![](twitter:AnChainAI/status/1431340148852084740)\n\n![](twitter:EvanDonoghue5/status/1431800011898056709)\n\nIndeed it seems like AnChain.AI have sold their soul to 'The Great Satan.' Come on guys, if it wasn't them, it would just be someone else, right? Also, not to be funny or anything, but there have been a couple of DeFi hacks in the past few months and it's unsettling to say the least.\n\n> Check out my previous articles about 'Hacking the DeFi Ecosystem' here on MSQ. Start with [Part I](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/hacking-the-defi-ecosystem-part-i) and then follow-up with [Part II](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/hacking-the-defi-ecosystem-part-ii)\n\nI don't think it's bad that there's some kind of watchdog in the DeFi space. Do I want that watchdog to be AnChain.AI under the auspices of the SEC? Not really. I would much prefer it that protocols work to secure and govern themselves responsibly rather than be subject to scrutiny from centralized entities, regardless of how good their intentions allegedly are. So we're at a bit of an impasse in some ways: either we hope that DeFi evolves naturally and that truly robust protocols come into being sooner than later, meaning there will undoubtedly be some collateral damage along the way, or concede to some regulatory oversight from centralized agencies, detracting from the whole point of crypto and DeFi, but protecting investors to a lesser or greater degree.\n\nIn all honesty, while both scenarios have their downsides, I think I would still prefer the former to the latter. However, the reality is that *both* will happen simultaneously. It's not really a choice, you see. As I've said in the past, regulation doesn't necessarily stifle innovation. In many respects, it actually encourages it, allowing for more inventive solutions to problems to be found. The fact is, you can't protect everyone from every single threat that's out there, whether you're a DeFi protocol or the SEC themselves. However, you can have an influence on the space, and the degree of that influence also depends on the other actors operating within that space and how they deal with your actions.\n\n## Good Cop, Bad Cop\n\nI get the feeling this is kinda what the SEC are doing in the cryptosphere. In fact, in a very recent interview with [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/), [Hester Peirce](https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce), the Commissioner of the SEC, has said that she and SEC Chair [Gary Gensler](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler) 'don't see eye to eye' on what exactly constitutes a security when considering these 'token offerings.'\n\n![](twitter:CoinDesk/status/1433401160518471684)\n\n> Peirce states that she and Gensler don't necessarily agree on what makes a cryptoasset a security\n\nIt's a sensitive issue and one that I think the SEC is trying to approach carefully without rocking the boat too much, believe it or not. That doesn't mean that I don't wonder about it and ask myself when there *will* actually be more clarity on these issues, because there always seems to be talk of regulation and providing more clarity, but very little follow through. It's annoying, but government organizations playing games is hardly a new thing. In fact, they quite literally make a career out of it, toying with policies and laws but only fully committing when there's enough cause for it, meaning money to be made or interests to be protected.\n\nBut even listening to Peirce, who seems eloquent and nice enough, makes me believe that these officials really have little to no clue about crypto, let alone DeFi and the protocols and smart contracts maintaining the ever-growing ecosystem. It feels a little desperate and futile to me, and to a large extent, ham-fisted.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YIgRtpN.jpg)\n\n> SEC be like...\n\nInstead of trying to understand the industry more and educating themselves, the SEC is outsourcing parts of it to take a not so hands-on approach to regulation. That's not how you build rapport with a community, and it's certainly no way to handle policy. There's a certain lexicon within the cryptosphere that has to be used intelligently, and until we start hearing some information that demonstrates an actual understanding of crypto and DeFi, my thoughts are that attempts at regulation will be ill-informed at worst and completely ineffective at best.\n\nThe SEC are pulling at straws and trying their best to understand something using methods that just don't make any sense. They might want to be Big Brother and pull all the strings, but people in DeFi have read *Nineteen Eighty Four* and have prepared for this eventuality. If US regulators aren't careful, they'll only serve to exacerbate the nation's current economic crisis and send a lot of money and innovation offshore, and that's not something any good American would want.",

A project has appeared to aid in this fight, using the most unlikely of tools: a video game. Trust me, you'll want to read this...***\n\n## The Birth of Information\n\nWe live in *The Information Age*. Computers and networks from all over the world exchange information every second of every day, all thanks to the internet. If you went back in time, it would be nearly impossible to explain it as anything but magic. So, who's the original magician?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gT0ttP3.png)\n\n> J.C.R. Licklider, the father of the internet. Thanks dad!\n\nMIT graduate *J.C.R. Licklider* is considered the one who first conceived the idea for the *World Wide Web*. He laid out concepts in his 'Galactic Network' memos in 1962, which described a system of interconnected computers all around the world that would allow anyone to quickly access data and information from any address provided. Sound familiar to you?\n\nIn that same year, Licklider was appointed the first *Head of Computer Research* at [DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/). There, he collaborated with other on the theory of [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET). It didn't take long for that concept to become a reality, one that would eventually evolve into the internet we know today.\n\nThe internet is built on one main idea: Open Architecture Networking, with the key word here being **open**. It laid the groundwork for Satoshi Nakamoto to give the world Bitcoin in 2009, causing a renaissance in censorship resistance through Blockchains. While the internet and Blockchains continue to free the masses from censorship, some governments have been hard at work to limit the power of these tools.\n\n## The Shepherds of Censorship\n\nSo, with the internet and Blockchains around, what's a corrupt government to do? You can't have all information freely accessible to everyone. Why, this would surely lead to a plague of free thinking amongst your citizenry! The answer? Simple. Centralize the internet, allowing you to control the information your people receive by selectively choosing what supports your goals and what doesn't.\n\nGovernments like North Korea, China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia have proven themselves to be masters in the art of control through information censorship. While each use their own tactics to determine what its people can actually access, all remain concretely in control of the internet.\n\n![](https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ca_nkvaccine_090321getty.jpg)\n\n> The king of censorship North Korean leader Kim Jung Un. I've heard Kimmy can talk to dolphins and doesn't poop. Both sound legit to me...\n\nNorth Korea is probably the most extreme when it comes to censorship. Its citizens often have no knowledge of what is truly going on in the world around them. I have seen personal vlog accounts of people visiting the insular Asian nation, which is only permitted through certain authorized travel agencies. You're literally told what you can and cannot photograph, what you can say, and even where you can go. The North Korean authorities even locked a vlogger's tour group inside their hotel at certain hours every day! Talk about oppressive!\n\nUnfortunately, censorship has allowed the government to convince many citizens that Kim Jung Un is a great leader. And while Kim tells an untold amount of lies to his people, including that he is a living god, I do think my favorite absurd story I have heard is that Kim Jung Un played golf for the first time and proceeded to shoot an 18. As in, 18 holes, 18 hole-in-ones.\n\nIt definitely threw me off guard. Why would anyone in his country even care if he was good at golf? Oh right, a god. Absolutely ridiculous! Anyway, as North Korea dishes out censorship in its own way, Saudi Arabia caught global attention with an extreme example of its own in recent years.\n\n## The Desert of Lies\n\nSaudi Arabia became the center of discussion for brutal censorship tactics back in 2018 when Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based journalist who was a vocal critic of Saudi Arabia's government, was murdered after entering a consulate in Istanbul. The world watched as the Saudi government repeatedly denied any wrongdoing while an evolving narrative of foul play emerged out of the ensuing investigations. Khashoggi was seen entering the consulate via a security camera feed, but there is no record of him leaving.\n\n![](https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3658587.1539193261!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_620_330/image.jpg)\n\n> Jamal Khashoggi walking into the Consulate\n\nThis fatal visit to uncover a major story resulted in Khashoggi never being seen or heard from again. The generally accepted narrative is that Khashoggi was murdered by the Saudi government, which I myself believe. Naturally, this is something the government repeatedly denies, claiming that he had been killed in a fight. Yeah, sure...\n\nThis tragic story shows the lengths some governments will go to silence dissenters. In fact, censorship in Saudi Arabia infects almost all forms of entertainment as well— only approved books, movies, games and television programs are circulated to the public. People caught with banned materials often face fines, imprisonment, or worse. These censorship controls are put in place through various means, but largely revolve around controlling information available via the Internet.\n\nBut not all hope is lost, as a group of reporters known as [Reporters Without Borders](https://rsf.org/) are fighting back in a very unique way.\n\n![](https://luminategroup.com/storage/561/c/reporterswithoutborders-logo%402x-logo.png)\n\n> Sticking it to censorship since 1985. Keep fighting the good fight!\n\n## Information Freedom Fighters\n\n*Reporters Without Borders*, was founded in 1985 by four reporters out of Montpelier, France. It has grown to become the current world authority in promoting and defending the right to report and access information. The organization monitors for violations regarding freedom of the press all over the world. Their primary approach is to expose these transgressions to other countries in order to garner support to scupper censorship.\n\nHowever, in more recent times, they have taken part in a particularly unique project that hopes to honor those lost in stopping censorship and continue that fight in a new and inventive way. Believe it or not, *Reporters Without Borders* are leveraging, of all things, the highly-acclaimed game [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) as a major tool in bringing uncensored news and information to the people who need it most.\n\n![](https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/cfn/11307uYG0CXzRuA9aryByTHYrQLFz-HVQ3VVl7aAysxK15HMpqjkAIcC_R5vdfZt52hAXQNHoYhSuoSq_46_MT_tDBcLu49I.png)\n\n> One of the most popular games of all time. And now a source for truth?\n\n## The Unseen Tool\n\nCreated within a seemingly basic, but hugely popular game, is a server (or World, depending on your *Minecraft* vocabulary) known as [The Uncensored Library](https://www.uncensoredlibrary.com/). The library, which went live in March of 2020, was built by [BlockWorks](https://www.blockworks.uk/), [DDB Berlin](https://www.ddb.com/), and *MediaMonks* as a way to continue the mission of anti-censorship and  honor the journalists Jamal Khashoggi, Yulia Berezovskaia, Nguyen Van Dai, Javier Valdez, and Mada Masr.\n\nThe library provides uncensored articles and news from Mexico, Russia, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. The library itself is divided up into 5 different areas, each of which is devoted to a select country honoring the journalists. These sections let anyone with access to the game read news and articles that would otherwise be censored and unavailable to them.\n\nAll the stories and articles are translated into English as well as the native language of the country or countries concerned. All information is transcribed into books that **anyone** can read hidden within *Minecraft*'s book assets, right under the noses of the very governments that approved the game. Amazing!\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hAQAeQKfglxn4bJkzThVcP1ckZ0=/0x0:3500x1969/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:3500x1969):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19814126/01_Uncensored_Library_island2.jpg)\n\n> The Uncensored Library— it's beautiful, and HUGE\n\nIronically, while these governments focus on controlling which websites and ideas are allowed, the ingenious plan to utilize *Minecraft* has seemingly slipped through the cracks. It also shows that every video game approved by these governments has the potential to be used in much the same way.\n\nIn time, *The Uncensored Library* could even prove to be the *Trojan Horse* that fuels the fight against censorship in many countries. I hope that there are thousands of offline copies of the library in these nations, because if this is true, it would prove very difficult for anyone to take this access away. Now, that really does sound familiar...\n\nSo after reading all about *The Uncensored Library*, why it was created and how it uses a video game as a way to honor people and spread decentralized information, I just knew I had to see this place for myself. And that's exactly what I did...\n\n## My Journey to The Uncensored Library\n\nAt the *The Uncensored Library* website, I downloaded a map file and followed the instructions on how to import the library file into my saved worlds offline (located lower down the page). I then started up the *Java* version of *Minecraft* and headed in. I was placed on a walkway leading up to the library entrance. I quickly realized my settings needed to be pushed harder to fully appreciate the scope of this place. So the first thing I can say is— this place is **huge**. And completely stunning.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LkGaNp9.jpg)\n\n> Pretty darn awesome if you ask me!\n\nBefore I entered the library, I wanted to briefly explore the external environment. As it so happens, this turned out to be good decision. Opposite the main entrance stood an impressive statue of a fist clenching the mighty pen, a fitting tribute to dedicated independent journalists.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BBcN5gd.jpg)\n\n> Seems like a solid statement right there\n\nI then decided to turn around and head back to the entrance. Upon entering the library, I came across an even more impressive sight— The Main Hall, which boasted an amazing concave dome covered in glass emblazoned with a map of the globe bordered by the library's name.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Cr3Ys5v.jpg)\n\n> The view you get just walking into this place. It's insane to think how long this would have taken to build!\n\nWhile walking on the glass, I noticed giant sculptures of books at all corners. Passing one, I ambled down the closest hallway as the surroundings became more and more awe-inspiring. As each block loaded in the distance, new structures and unique ornate designs built into the floors, walls and ceiling were revealed. It's nothing short of a truly great monument to freedom of speech even without its hidden troves of information.\n\nHeading down the hallway, I reached a room with tentacles protruding out of what I assumed was the floor. After actually entering the room, I soon realized the tentacles belonged to a massive model of a *Kraken* and that the floor was actually water.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1oGXv0u.jpg)\n\n> Release the Kraken! ...Anybody?\n\nAfter climbing out of the water (that I totally didn't fall into), I saw what looked like a shrine on the other side of the room. Which was wall-to-wall bookshelves that went up three levels. I headed over to the shrine and discovered two book alters, one for English and the other for Russian. I then noticed that this was written in huge letters on the wall directly opposite me.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/t4ws5jG.jpg)\n\n> The Kraken makes more sense now...\n\nI accessed the book and viewed page after page of basic text that had been transcribed from the author *Yulia Berezovskaia*, who is credited at this shrine. After a while I closed up the book and proceeded to peruse every section one by one. Each was unique in its own way and credited one of the authors honored by the library. Moreover, each respective section is full of censored material that is freely available to *Minecraft* across the world.\n\nI had officially made my pilgrimage and paid my respects. I had the privilege of experiencing an amazing initiative that uses a game to hide uncensored information, and I can say with full confidence that *The Uncensored Library* is definitely worth the trip.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vL49TiW.jpg)\n\n> The other remaining areas...still can't believe how much time this would have taken. So many distinct messages in each room\n\nThe pictures don't do justice to the library, and I encourage those of you who have *Minecraft* (and even those of you who don't) to visit and see for yourself. The sheer scale, work, and care that went into honoring each journalist is beyond comprehension. This digital landmark opens up all-new potential to use games as an effective tool to combat censorship. *The Uncensored Library* is truly something to behold!",

      "body": "***If you're an avid fan of billionaires who wantonly manipulate human beings for personal gain, this article may not be for you. However, if you're in favor of decentralization and autonomy, then read on. The metaverse is a big deal, and the idea of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg holding the reins is somewhat...concerning. Check it out!***\n\n## Not-so-Virtual Reality\n\nThe term 'metaverse' has seen many contexts since being coined in [Neal Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson)’s 1992 science fiction novel [Snow Crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash). For futurists; a thought exercise. In cryptocurrency; a meme. For gaming companies; an ad campaign. But when [Mark Zuckerberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg) did an interview with [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/) in July, discussing his vision to pioneer the metaverse as a successor to the internet, many began seeing the future of the term as something else– *a reality.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BD0DSSQ.jpg)\n\n> Neal Stephenson's Sci-Fi epic is a veritable blueprint for the metaverse\n\nThe interview, more than anything, rejuvenated excitement to a years old concept, one that already exists and is in use everyday. If you’ve ever played [Fortnite](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home), or [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/), or [Grand Theft Auto](https://www.rockstargames.com/V/), you’ve experienced metaverse-like tendencies.\n\nBut the vision Zuck has for the metaverse is not an iteration of these games. It’s a metaverse built first and foremost by [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) itself, centered around the future of virtual reality, pioneered by its own company [Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/). In this metaverse, Mark Zuckerberg has anointed himself the protagonist. And there’s a lot wrong with his vision...\n\n## Does the Metaverse Need VR?\n\nTo start, a metaverse built around the capabilities of virtual reality is short-sighted. When it comes to VR, I think [Wired](https://www.wired.com/)'s David Ka said it best:\n\n> *It never stops failing upward, forever graded on a generous curve, always judged based on its 'potential' rather than its results.*\n\nWhen Zuckerberg said that the technological capabilities to run the metaverse will be reached 'within the decade,' the only technology he’s referring to is virtual reality. The other components that will flesh out the metaverse– permissionless identity, high-speed exchange of financial services, integration of NFTs– already exist thanks to Blockchain technology, something Zuckerberg fails to mention a single time during his interview.\n\n![](youtube:frZQrEBVkkk)\n\n> *'Tell them about Blockchain Mark!'*\n\nIf you’re wondering why Zuck leaves out the importance of Blockchain and cryptocurrency to the metaverse, it’s probably because he’d prefer his version of the space to exist without them. Zuckerberg is careful to align the integral aspects of the metaverse’s future with the services *Facebook* can provide, with a metaverse that requires every user to buy an *Oculus* headset and sign into *Facebook* being the end goal. The key for Zuckerberg is not to convince the masses that this version of the metaverse is necessarily the best, but the most practical. This strategy is far from something unique to how the company has handled its other products.\n\n## The Reality of Zuckerberg’s Vision\n\nThere may be no better example of Zuckerberg’s short-sighted vision for the metaverse than *Facebook’s* recent advertisement for [Horizon Workrooms](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/introducing-horizon-workrooms-remote-collaboration-reimagined/). In the ad, an employee uses their Oculus device to scan their desk, transporting themselves into a virtual office space where they begin interacting with their coworkers as avatars. Visually, the interactions scream metaverse, trying to bring its definition to life. This product was foreshadowed during Zuck’s interview where he mentioned the concept of an 'infinite office' that can improve productivity.\n\n![](youtube:lgj50IxRrKQ)\n\n> Who wouldn't want to wear a VR headset from 9 to 5?\n\nWhen you read Zuckerberg’s comments on how the metaverse can be used to increase the productivity of remote work, it comes off as terrifyingly authentic. You can tell this is something he’s passionate about, to no fault of his own. This is a man who for the last decade has had his own vision of innovations driven by stakeholders. And his vision for the metaverse, ultimately, is just that: a collection of products and services that drive profits and can improve his own company.\n\nHorizon Workrooms is not, and will never be, the metaverse. In reality, the metaverse is not *Facebook’s* future, but its greatest fear. A world with a fully functioning metaverse would render *Facebook* useless. The company’s greatest asset is its social graph, its datasets, and the ability to monetize its users’ behavior.\n\nFor years, *Facebook’s* greatest priority has been one thing– to keep its users on the platform. And when it fails to do this, threatened by other, superior products, it simply uses its resources to absorb its competitors altogether. The metaverse is not about corralling users to the services of a single company. In fact, quite the opposite is true. The metaverse is about exploring an open world of interoperable identities governed by no single individual entity. It could be, in effect, the death of *Facebook* and companies like it.\n\n## A Transition of Power\n\nIf you were to ask me about why the metaverse as a concept carries personal excitement, my answer would be twofold. The first part being that, as someone who loves gaming, cryptocurrency and digital collectibles, the metaverse has the potential to be a superset of all those things.\n\nThe idea of meeting my friends who live across the country in the metaverse, arriving in style on the wings of a pterodactyl with my avatar’s new superhero skin on display, is something I will not let go of until it exists for me to experience. I truly believe that the metaverse is the future of entertainment, and I’m its target demographic.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/psSKZZD.gif)\n\nThe second reason I look forward to the potential of the metaverse is that it could lead to the fall of incumbent technology giants, and transform the way society interacts with the digital world in a healthier and more sustainable way. I often contemplate the demise of retail shopping during the rise of [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/); the destruction it has caused, the way it's revolutionized logistics, and its effect on the world outside of its industry.\n\nThe metaverse has the potential to achieve similar disruption among the titans of technology and social media, but in a direction led by fairness, interoperability and, most of all, creativity. I hope to one day live in a world where my digital presence is driven not by profits, but by authentic human connections. While there is no guarantee the metaverse will achieve this goal, its potential gives me hope.",

      "slug": "what-is-an-nft-beginners-guide",
      "body": "***So you wanna learn about NFTs, huh? Well...you've come to the right place! In this article we'll explore what an NFT is and how to mint one. We'll also talk about how to avoid scams and cover a couple of general tips and tricks along the way. Finally, we'll dive into some cool projects for you to consider starting off with. Let's go!*** \n\n> **Please Note** - In no way, shape or form should this article be considered financial advice. Always do your due diligence and make an informed decision before committing capital towards any investment.\n\n## What's an NFT? What's a Blockchain?\n\nSo, what *is* an NFT? Well, that's a great question. The official definition is: \n\n> 'A non-fungible token is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable. NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files'\n\nNow if you're anything like me, I'm going to take a wild guess and assume that all of the above didn't exactly hit home, so let's break it down a little, shall we?\n\n*Non-fungible* means that the token is more or less unique and cannot be replaced with something else. For example, cryptocurrencies, like [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), they are **fungible** because you can exchange BTC or ETH for another currency, be it fiat or otherwise. You can also use BTC and ETH to purchase products or services from different merchants across the world. However, in contrast, something like Cryptopunk #7523 is **non-fungible** because there is only one in existence, making it unique, scarce and very rare. Morever, it cannot be readily exchanged or converted into another currency or used to make a purchase, hence it is non-fungible.\n\nNow that we have that out the way...What's a Blockchain? For some of you, this might be something you already know well. But hey, we're all about learning here at MSQ, so it never hurts to refresh your memory, right? Simply put, a Blockchain is the technology that underpins NFTs. While there are several explanations of a Blockchain, we rather like this one:\n\n> 'A Blockchain is an open and public network that is secure and extremely difficult to tamper with. Moreover, it allows for the existence and exchange of digital assets that aren't issued by central governments'\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/N70cdty.png)\n\n> Cryptopunk #7523\n\n## OK, I Get it Now, But What Uses Do NFTs Have?\n\nNow that we've explained what NFTs are and the technology behind them, let's dive into why some are selling for thousands or even millions of dollars. We'll also discuss some of the uses they have and where you might find them...\n\n### Collectibles\n\nA common theme we see in the current NFT space is PFP (Profile Picture) projects. This is where 10,000 (or a similar amount) of randomly generated NFTs will be created with the entire process being carried out via a smart contract. An example of a randomly generative PFP project is [Lazy Lions](https://www.lazylionsnft.com/) that's been all over Twitter lately.\n\nIn these projects, each NFT is entirely unique, meaning no two are exactly the same. Many projects have tons of traits that characters may possess with some being rarer than others. A lot of people like to collect these types of NFTs and flip them for a profit, but some of these projects simply feature such awesome and distinct artwork, which is why their popularity is so enduring.\n\nNFT projects like [SuperNfty Floating Heads](https://www.supernfty.com/) and [Dead Freaks](https://opensea.io/collection/dead-freaks) are two of my favorites to date. All Dead Freaks are hand drawn and feature unnervingly ghoulish (or even downright terrifying) monstrosities complete with their own dreadful, shall we say...personalities? Owning a Dead Freak gives you access to the Fang Gang, making you eligible for special drops and more!\n\nIn stark contrast, [SuperNfty Floating Heads](https://opensea.io/collection/super-nfty-floating-heads) are all hand sculpted in VR (super nifty, right?) and feature lively, colorful floating heads complete with a range of different potential applications. Upon purchasing one, you receive your head's commercial license as well as a 3D printable file, metaverse file and more! See? I told you they were super nifty!\n\n### Gaming\n\n> NFTs and Gaming: a match made in heaven. You can check out my esteemed colleague [Matt Spizarny](https://MSQ.io/users/spizzo) AKA Spizzo's article on Gaming & NFTs and why they go so well together [here](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/the-bittersweet-relationship-of-gaming-and-nfts)\n\nOne of the main points here is that you can truly own really cool stuff in a digital world. Nobody can take your in-game items away from you because *you* own them. Additionally, they exist on a decentralized network and are inaccessible to anyone but you. You can sell your items, trade them, level them up to make them rarer...it's just fantastic! Some Blockchain games I think are pretty rad (and ones you may want to check out soon) include [Blankos: Block Party](https://blankos.com/), [Lost Relics](https://lostrelics.io/) and [Ember Sword](https://embersword.com/).\n\n### Access Tokens\n\nFinally, NFTs can be used as access tokens. [GET Protocol](https://www.get-protocol.io/) is one such example of an entity that fulfills this flawlessly— they help anyone who issues tickets to take advantage of the digital world by turning tickets into...you guessed it: NFTs!\n\nNow transforming tickets into NFTs has many advantages. First off, it makes tickets into collectible items that have (and may very well increase in) value. Secondly, organizers get total control over the issuing process as well as insights into both the primary & secondary markets. Lastly, organizers and performers receive all the profits that would have otherwise gone to scalpers and intermediaries. In short, GET is making serious progress in fundamentally changing the way the ticketing industry operates.\n\nThe above are just a few of the current uses for NFTs, but in my opinion, the possibilities are virtually endless!\n\n## How Do I Mint an NFT?\n\nSo in this section, I'm going to take you step-by-step through the minting process so that you can purchase your first NFT. This is going to be a lot of fun, so without further ado, let's dive straight in:\n\nBefore we begin, you're going to need a few things to get started:\n\n* A [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet\n* Some ETH, and\n* An [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) account (which just means you'll need to log in to your MetaMask wallet)\n\nAs a newbie, you can buy ETH directly inside your MetaMask wallet by clicking on 'Buy.' The following image demonstrates how to buy some ETH:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jS8wTFF.png)\n\nOnce you have your wallet set up, OpenSea account and some ETH, it's time to mint your first NFT! How exciting!\n\nNow comes the hardest part: finding an NFT project you actually want to invest in. There are *thousands* of NFT projects out there, and it can be really difficult to determine which ones will do well and which won't. However, these are a few factors I like to take into account: \n\n* **Artwork** - Is it distinct, memorable and relatable?\n* **Community** - How active and united are the community?\n* **Developers** - Are they trustworthy, driven, forward-thinking and innovative?\n* **Roadmap** - Is there a roadmap for the project? What releases are planned and how will they help to grow the community and project as a whole?\n\nSo let's take [Approving Corgis](https://approvingcorgis.com/public-mint/) as an example.\n\nApproving Corgis is a collection of 9,999 adorable corgis living on the Ethereum Blockchain, generated using 350+ unique attributes. Awesome, now let's say you want to mint one. First, head over to their [website](https://approvingcorgis.com/public-mint/) and click the **Mint** button. We can see that 2,191 have been minted, so there's still plenty left to purchase.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/I40O3xd.png)\n\nAfter clicking the **Mint** button and connecting your wallet, the site will tell you the minting price and ask you how many you would like to mint. In this case, let's say I want to mint 1. After inputting the amount I'd like to mint, I click the **Mint** button.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/etq7gpS.png)\n\nAfter hitting the **Mint** button, your MetaMask will pop up at the top-right of your screen. Here you can review your transaction. The details include the minting price, which in this case is 0.05 ETH plus gas fees.\n\nHold on a minute...what are gas fees!? These are payments made by users to compensate for the computing energy required to process and validate transactions on the Ethereum Blockchain. Gas fees can vary drastically and sometimes be very high, making your transaction significantly more expensive. You can check what price gas is currently sitting at [here](https://etherscan.io/gastracker).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jfOtCVr.png)\n\nCongrats! You're ready to mint! Just hit the **Confirm** button and let the Blockchain do its job. In a few minutes, you should see your brand new NFT show up in your OpenSea wallet. Easy as that! Wasn't so hard, was it?\n\nDepending on the project you're minting from, there may not be an instant reveal. This means you will have to wait until your NFT is available to see which one you got and what traits it has. This isn't really a big deal, but it varies from project to project, so just be sure to check their website before minting so you know what's up!\n\n## Tips & Tricks\n\nLet's run through some final quick-fire tips and tricks, shall we?\n\n* Never give anyone your private keys or seed phrases under any circumstances whatsoever\n* If MetaMask isn't working on Google Chrome, try Firefox\n* Be sure to always double check that you are on the project's official website and/or OpenSea\n* Losing Gas Wars? Check out this helpful [guide](https://twitter.com/thedigitalvee/status/1404485588699463686?s=20) by [thedigitalvee](https://twitter.com/thedigitalvee)\n* If the Mint button isn't working on the project's website, try minting directly from the smart contract. Check out this helpful [guide](https://twitter.com/ColeThereum/status/1419832999668076545?s=20) by [ColeThereum](https://twitter.com/ColeThereum) on how to do this\n* Check out this [MSQ video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNs3xiUmups) to help you avoid rug pulls and scams\n\n## Check Out These Awesome Projects\n\nBefore we conclude this article, let me show you some of my favorite NFT projects in the space right now 👀\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hO1Et2H.png)\n\n[Lazy Lions](https://www.lazylionsnft.com/)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zK0Oh0C.png)\n\n[0N1 Force](https://www.0n1force.com/)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fY4l5kB.png)\n\n[Lonely Alien Space Club](https://lonelyaliens.com/)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iSh2Wtg.png)\n\n[Axolittles](https://axolittles.io/)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWell, that's it for this special little Guide.

      "body": "***We recently unveiled that GET Protocol is our [September 2021 Project of the Month](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/get-protocol-is-our-project-of-the-month-september-2021), and for good reason too. However, while we've touched on their achievements and products, we haven't really gotten into the nitty-gritty of what they're actually trying to achieve. There's more to this project than good tech and a dedicated team. Indeed, by focusing on the most important part of the equation, namely real human beings, GET is striving for something far more profound than meets the eye...***\n\n## The Golden Ticket\n\nWhen you want to attend a concert or similar big event, you log on to the internet, navigate to a major ticket company and make your purchase. The amount you spend and the type of ticket you acquire will have a significant influence on your overall experience, but beyond this, your ticket serves no further purpose...it's simply a means to an end.\n\nBut you aren't the only person who holds a ticket. In all likelihood, there are many other people all holding their own tickets with their own respective benefits and/or limitations. What do you know about these people though? Anything at all? How could you have anything in common with them? Well, for one, you're attending the same event as them, so there's little doubt that some kind of connection exists, no matter how fleeting or transient it might be.\n\nYou might not want to be bosom pals with every single event-goer, but maybe you wouldn't mind spending a good night out with one or more of them again. After all, a concert isn't much if it doesn't come complete with an enraptured crowd all uproariously shouting their praises for performers and musicians. There's something truly transcendent about such events, and it's these experiences that are etched into the memories of people all over the world.\n\nLive events are built on human relationships and camaraderie between attendees, organizers and performers. But these meaningful connections are severed once the lights go out and everyone goes home. But this need not be the case. Imagine there was a way to keep everyone in the ticketing chain connected before, during and after an event. Sounds unfeasible? Think again. [GET Protocol](https://www.get-protocol.io/) already has this covered. Thanks to their innovative approach to ticketing, the functionality, versatility, and overall value attached to their tickets ensures that everyone in the chain is a winner. In essence, there isn't just one 'Golden Ticket.' The reality is...they all are!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hHQfr5q.jpg)\n\n> GET Protocol's approach means every ticket is a Golden Ticket\n\n## Entertainment in a World of Uncertainty\n\nIt's no secret that the outbreak of the Coronavirus has had a major impact on businesses and individuals all over, and the entertainment industry has been one of the most adversely affected thus far. While it may be true that nothing is certain, it goes without saying that the levels of uncertainty post Corona are at an all-time high.\n\nEvent organizers run the risk of suffering huge losses and having to spend a massive amount of time making new arrangements if an event is postponed or canceled. Moreover, fans are disinclined to purchase tickets because they may believe the event simply won't happen or that they won't get their money back. In the meantime, musicians and performers miss out on opportunities to share their art, grow their fan bases and earn a living. What can be done to minimize risks and safeguard the interests of all parties concerned?\n\nThe answer is simple: you employ the best Blockchain-based ticketing service on the market with innovative products and a fully inclusive, connection-first approach. Yup, I'm talking about GET Protocol again. What exactly affords these guys such an edge over their centralized and entrenched counterparts? A good combination of gusto, real-world experience and a philosophy that favors interconnection, innovation and progression of course. Much of this is possible thanks to GET's [White-Label](https://www.get-protocol.io/white-label), a product designed to nurture human connections and ensure they grow and last.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UWGvKEj.png)\n\n> White-Label brings an entirely new element to the world of live events\n\nThe benefits of GET Protocol’s White-Label product are immediately apparent: any inspired entrepreneur, fledgling ticketing business or event organizer can replicate the battle-tested and complete white-label ticketing solution that has been employed at real events across the world. Going from zero ticketing to scalable ticketing with a fully customizable suite of tools that provide event organizers with more data, greater revenue and, most importantly, a clear connection between artists and attendees, is all possible thanks to White-Label. As GET puts it:\n\n> *'Our white-label has also revealed some gleaming benefits during the current pandemic, as an ever changing event climate has resulted in many events needing canceling or rescheduling for dates and location. With the white-label, GUTS Tickets could transfer 40k+ tickets for a singular event to a new venue at the flick of a button whilst keeping revenue'*\n\nNow I don't know about you, but that sounds like pure magic to me. Just the total number of hours saved is something worth celebrating, let alone the fact that attendees can still get what they paid for and organizers can retain their revenue. If this isn't a quantum leap forward in the world of event planning and organizing, I don't know what is.\n\n## No More Scalpers\n\nMaybe one of the biggest benefits allowing people from all walks of life to come together and enjoy themselves is GET's approach to eliminating scalping. This is because any tickets issued through GET are 'smart tickets' tied to a Blockchain. This means that only individuals with the requisite authority can make any changes to tickets in terms of benefits, restrictions and pricing (to name but a few). In other words, anyone wanting to buy large quantities of tickets, mark them up and sell them for a profit in the secondary market simply can't because they lack the agency and ability to do so. The result is that tickets remain fairly priced, accessible to all and incapable of being altered, sabotaged or reproduced.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/D0WTygC.jpg)\n\n> Only if you don't use GET Protocol Buzz...\n\nThe reality is that if any kind of resale or discount is permitted, it's only because the organizers of the event allow it. The real beauty of GET Protocol is that event organizers set the rules and can customize their attendees' experiences down to the finest detail. Additionally, all of this can be done almost instantly without having to take any laborious, time-intensive actions. Virtually every last aspect of the ticketing and live event experience has been considered, and so the whole process is effectively automated. As soon as companies in other parts of the world get wind of GET's unparalleled tech, I expect a mass exodus the likes of which can only be described as Biblical in scale.\n\n## Mementos? Memorabilia? NFTs!\n\nTo top all this excellence off, GET also offers [the Digital Twin](https://www.get-protocol.io/digital-twin), a product that gives ticket issuers the world over the ability to 'supercharge' their tickets by creating Non-Fungible Token (NFT) replicas of them, thereby transforming them into provably rare items with intrinsic value. Best of all, existing ticket providers need not make any major migrations to a new platform or modify their operations to integrate this technology. GET's *Digital Twin* allows them to create 'NFT copies' of their existing and future tickets and store them digitally on a Blockchain. This means that these pieces of memorabilia or rewards (depending on the preferences of ticket providers) cannot be destroyed, tampered with or stolen and will always be accessible to individuals who own these NFTs.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/akuAlNC.png)\n\n> Just a small sample of the benefits by using GET Protocol\n\nI said it once, and I'll say it again: every ticket issued or enhanced by GET Protocol is golden. In fact, it would be incorrect to call them a Blockchain-based smart ticketing solution. That just doesn't do them justice. They're much closer to something like magicians or wizards if you ask me. In all seriousness though, what GET Protocol does is far deeper than the tech, innovation and slick aesthetics: they empower people to achieve more, connect more and communicate more directly and honestly with one another. They also facilitate the creation of memorable experiences free from strife, ambivalence and confusion. What more could you possibly want?\n\nWhat's more, you'll want to hang on to your tickets and cherish them because they're actually worth something and have meaning. Not so long ago (and even still) tickets just allowed you to enter an event and access certain areas. Thankfully GET Protocol has seen the light and made it their mission to fully unleash the potential within each and every ticket they produce or augment. Few Blockchain projects are this committed to their audience and ethos, and it is this commitment to excellence and progress that has earned GET Protocol the title of our September 2021 Project of the Month.\n\n## Memories That Live On\n\nI can tell you that, as part of the MSQ team, we value the humans behind projects, NFTs and games and want to tell their stories in an authentic and meaningful way. It's little wonder then that we 'GET' along so well with GET Protocol and identify with their vision for a better world.\n\nBy focusing on the real experiences of people in their daily lives, and by allowing them to have some agency in these experiences (and feel valued for their individual contributions), there is little doubt that a community of empowered, united people is coming to life. By giving people the opportunity to get more back from and feel included in events, GET has managed to tap into the hearts and minds of their audience and demonstrate that they really do put human beings and their needs first.",

Whether it's their art, their vibrant communities, or the unique features planned for their projects, there is definitely something here that will grab you. Today we bring you Approving Corgis!***\n\n## About Approving Corgis\n\nApproving Corgis is a collection of 9,999 adorable corgis living on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain, generated using 350+ unique attributes. The Corgis feature many variable traits including fur color, facial features, outfits, headgear, accessories and backgrounds. No two Corgis are identical.\n\nA few perks and benefits you gain access to when purchasing a Corgi is the Community Vault. This serves as the treasury from which funds are drawn to support worthy community members and their initiatives. You'll also be able to make use of the 'Do the Deed' Breeding Station which gives you the ability to mate two Approving Corgis, combining your favorite traits from the two to produce a new Corgi pup, and all free of charge.\n\nFinally, purchasing a Corgi means you will become part of the Approving Corgis Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Approving Corgis aims to be a 100% community-oriented group by allowing members to vote on project priorities, goals, and initiatives.\n\nApproving Corgis has four different rarity tiers you could potentially obtain your Corgi from, namely Approving, Disapproving, Rare and Super Rare. Let's check out some below!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nI9KmZb.png)\n\n> **Tier 1** - Approving\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/suTLa6q.jpg)\n\n> **Tier 2** - Disapproving\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nJxTI8e.jpg)\n\n> **Tier 3** - Rare\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MvpL4PI.jpg)\n\n> **Tier 4** - Super Rare\n\n## What's Next for Approving Corgis?\n\nApproving Corgis has a bright future ahead of it! Some things the team plans to carry out in the near future includes raffles, giveaways, applying to [Rarity Sniper](https://twitter.com/raritysnipernft?lang=en), a charity fund, merchandise drops, and more. Check out the detailed RUFFmap below:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tGTJqHm.png)\n\nRUFFmap (Roadmap) 2.0 will be proliferated to and voted on by the community through DAO. If you want to follow progress more closely, you can join their [Discord](https://discord.gg/stHM8wEkZY) to stay in the loop regarding special announcements and upcoming events.\n\n## Statistics\n\nAt present, the Approving Corgis have just wrapped up Wave 1 of the public sale where 3,333 Corgis were sold. A poll will soon be generated to decide when Wave 2 will commence. Be sure to join their Discord and visit their [website](https://approvingcorgis.com/) to mint your own Approving Corgi when Wave 2 begins!\n\n* **Total Items** - 9,999\n* **Owners** - 1K\n* **Floor Price** - 0.05 ETH\n* **Volume Traded** - 15.4 ETH\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage on SubStack](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar)*\n\n*We will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) every Friday at 3PM EST.

      "name": "Scaling: Peeling Back the Layers",
      "slug": "scaling-peeling-back-the-layers",
      "body": "***'The Scalability Trilemma' taught us to think differently in how we approach the issue of scaling Blockchain networks and revealed that our perceived limitations are often based on incorrect assumptions. In this article, we continue our journey by peeling back the layers to reveal what scaling looks like today as well as what the future holds.***\n\n---\n\nOn our last adventure down the crypto rabbit hole, we looked at the [Scalability Trilemma](https://MSQ.io/blog/the-scalability-trilemma) and discussed the concept of scaling and how it applies to Blockchain architecture using the concept of 'Layers.' We also learned that our limitations are often rooted in false assumptions about what we *can* do.\n\nIn this article, we'll continue our journey by 'peeling back the layers' to get a better look at just how these layers are used and what solutions currently exist. There is indeed some ground to cover, but fear not, young Padawan...for the Force will be with you, always!\n\nWe got this! ✊\n\n![](https://media1.giphy.com/media/GvGEWpWm7vJra/giphy.gif)\n\n## Ready Layer-1\n\n![(Warner Bros./Getty Images/Ringer illustration)](https://i.ibb.co/X5QZCjk/1-0-Zr-Llr8w-DTtcz-Jea-Mgn9v-A-0-0-0.gif)\n\nMuch like the [Oasis](https://readyplayerone.fandom.com/wiki/OASIS) in [Ready Player One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One_(film)), a Blockchain's Layer-1 (L1) is considered the 'Base Layer.' This is the lowest level where solutions affect the main way that a Blockchain works. To scale on L1 means changing the rules of the protocol itself and doesn't offer much to combat the [inherent issues](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/the-scalability-trilemma#the-trilemma) involved in L1 scaling.\n\nFor instance, the *Oasis* doesn't seem to have any major latency issues, and that's because it suffers from a high level of centralization. I mean, the entire premise of the story *is* a race for control over its fate. And while a more robust architecture spanning multiple layers sounds awesome, it would make for a pretty boring story...'IOI' could be like, 'All your eggs are belong to us! Bwahahaha!' and everyone else would just be like, 'Cool story, bro.'\n\n<div style=\"width: 75%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/RpzTrf6/Halliday.jpg)\n  \n> \"If you push [the button]...and the whole simulation shuts down.\"\n\n</div>\n\n---\n\n**Bonus Content**: [MSQ Youtube: The Blockchains of 'Ready Player One'](https://youtu.be/_PYKp06wlGY) by [Justin Renken](https://MSQ.io/users/justin)\n\n---\n\n### Consensus Changes\n\n***'Consensus changes'*** affect how blocks are created.\n\n![src: https://ig.com](https://i.ibb.co/99Fg38T/consensus.png)\n\nMost notably, on the [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org) Network, different ideas on how consensus should operate have led to contentious forks that resulted in projects like [Bitcoin Cash](https://bitcoincash.org) and [Bitcoin Gold](https://bitcoingold.org).\n\nIn [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) 2.0, the consensus algorithm will change from [Proof-of-Work (PoW)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) to [Proof-of-Stake (PoS)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake). The main idea behind this is to allow for faster block creation by getting rid of the computational overhead associated with mining/PoW.\n\nIn PoS, blocks are processed and validated by network participants who instead are required to stake collateral on-chain. This effectively incentivizes being honest since they have 'skin in the game.' Basically, acting dishonestly means losing some of their collateral via a mechanism known as [slashing](https://consensys.net/knowledge-base/ethereum-2/glossary/#slashing).\n\n### Sharding\n\n***[Sharding](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture))*** changes how the network itself is distributed.\n\n![https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html - Original diagram by Hsiao-wei Wang, design by Quantstamp](https://i.ibb.co/ZfwKGRS/sharding.jpg)\n\nWith sharding, a network's database is split across different sub-networks where each 'shard' contains a portion of the network's data. In the case of Ethereum 2.0, the main chain becomes one of these shards and will be the only one allowed to process transactions or execute smart contracts, where an additional [Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain) coordinates communication between the main chain and its shards.\n\n## Layer-2: Insert Coin\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/gMCfv0F/F6-A16-FF7-33-C5-4483-A138-4210-F8-B29-EB4.gif)\n\n</div>\n\nIn contrast to L1 solutions, Layer-2 (L2) solutions change the way you *use* a Blockchain and can function independently from the main chain.\n\nIn our [Scalability Trilemma](https://MSQ.io/blog/the-scalability-trilemma) article, we compared L1 vs L2 to writing a penalty in grade school with L1 being the act of writing 50 lines by hand onto a single sheet of paper. L2 would be more like typing the line once, then copy-pasting the remaining lines before printing it off to turn in to your teacher.\n\n### State Channels\n\n***'State Channels'*** use multi-signature contracts that allow participants to interact freely off-chain with the final results settling on the main chain. State Channels can be implemented in various ways that are often application-specific.\n\n![https://research.csiro.au/blockchainpatterns/general-patterns/data-management-patterns/state-channel](https://i.ibb.co/NTxM29G/state-channels.png)\n\nOne notable example of a State Channel is the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network) which creates peer-to-peer (P2P) payment channels where the final results settle on the [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org) Network.\n\nThe drawback to using State Channels is that the main chain has no way to validate what takes place off-chain. Each solution requires that participants rely on the security of the protocol they're using.\n\nThis can be thought of as something like having a table at a swap or rummage sale. Payments and items can change hands quite a bit over the duration of the sale. But at the end of the day, everyone gets paid out accordingly.\n\nProjects using State Channels:\n\n* [Connext](https://connext.network)\n* [Kchannels](https://www.kchannels.io)\n* [Perun](https://perun.network)\n* [Raiden](https://raiden.network)\n* [Statechannels.org](https://statechannels.org)\n\n### Sidechains\n\n***'Sidechains'*** are essentially clones of their main chain. They're, functionally speaking, almost completely identical; the only distinctions being that they run in *parallel* to the main chain and often implement their own consensus algorithms.\n\n![https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Sidechain](https://i.ibb.co/Q9MmyTP/sidechain.png)\n\nOn Ethereum, Sidechains are based on the [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm) and are even able to execute Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nSidechains, like State Channels, also require that participants rely on the security of the protocol they're using as the main chain has no way to guarantee data that's processed off-chain.\n\nProjects using Side Chains:\n\n* [POA Network](https://www.poa.network)\n* [Skale](https://skale.network)\n* [xDai](https://www.xdaichain.com)\n\n### Plasma\n\n***'Plasma'*** chains are anchored to their main 'parent' as a 'child' chain. While each 'child' has its own consensus model, its primary function is to offload computations from their 'parent' chain.\n\n![https://coincentral.com/plasma-an-innovative-framework-to-scale-ethereum](https://i.ibb.co/yqJFV9D/plasma.jpg)\n\nMuch like [Optimistic Rollups](#rollups), discussed further below, Plasma chains submit a transaction *'fraud proof'* to their parent.\n\nA popular analogy to explain Sidechains is to compare child chains to a Casino. You swap Dollars for poker chips, then cash out when you're done, basically ensuring that your chips are backed by something of the same value.\n\nProjects using Plasma:\n\n* [Gazelle](https://gzle.io)\n* [Gluon](https://gluon.network)\n* [LeapDAO](https://ipfs.leapdao.org)\n* [OMG Network](https://omg.network)\n* [Polygon](https://polygon.technology)\n\n### Rollups\n\n***'Rollups'*** are one of the newest and most promising ways to further scale a Blockchain.\n\nOne way to think about Rollups is to consider the act of sending holiday cards to your Aunt and Uncle. Using L1 methods, you could send one card to each of them as well as each of your cousins. Using L2 would be more like putting all the cards into one envelope and sending them together. So one stamp vs five stamps, which is cheaper and less work for the Post Office, and your relatives still get all the cards.\n\nThe key advantage of Rollups over other L2 scaling solutions is that Rollups require that proofs be committed to the main chain. This means users don't have to rely solely on the security of a given L2 implementation as transactions and contract executions can be secured by the main chain.\n\n**Optimistic Rollups**\n\n***'Optimistic Rollups'*** batch transactions and contract executions off-chain and commit the result to the parent chain along with a 'fraud proof'.\n\n![https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups](https://i.ibb.co/wpG51td/rollups-optimistic.png)\n\nA 'fraud proof' is an on-chain 'statement' or 'promise' that can be challenged by any party that suspects fraud. These statements and challenges require collateral to be locked by each party, where either acting dishonestly means losing some (or all) of their locked collateral. Results committed to a parent chain by Optimistic Rollups are essentially presumed to be correct... (<-- that's the 'optimistic' part).\n\nThis is kinda like playing [Guess Who](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_Who) or [Battleship](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)). Players operate on the honor system, except bystanders are allowed to call out cheaters. If the player *was* cheating, their funds get slashed; but if the challenger was wrong, *their* funds get slashed.\n\nIn the case of Optimistic Rollups, the challenge period can last up to a week or more. This gives extra time for the transactions to be scrutinized but also means users have to wait to withdraw their funds until after the challenge period has ended.\n\nProjects using Optimistic Rollups:\n\n* [Cartesi](https://cartesi.io)\n* [Fuel Network](https://fuel.sh)\n* [Offchain Labs Arbitrum Rollup](https://offchainlabs.com)\n* [OMGX](https://omgx.network)\n* [Optimism](https://optimism.io)\n\n**ZK Rollups**\n\n***'ZK Rollups'*** batch transactions and contract executions off-chain, but commit the result to the parent chain along with a cryptographically provable 'validity proof' known as a 'zk-SNARK', or *Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge.*\n\n![https://medium.com/fcats-blockchain-incubator/how-zk-rollups-work-8ac4d7155b0e](https://i.ibb.co/ynsrW0y/rollups-zk.png)\n\nWait...ZK what?\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/dg3jdHD/hold-up.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nZero-knowledge...Succinct...Mmkay...So that's some pretty heavy terminology, to say the least. What this *basically* means is that, instead of assuming 'optimistically' that all participants are being honest, the on-chain commit includes mathematical evidence *proving* the results are valid without revealing details about what happened inside the batch.\n\nThis, in a way, would be more like playing [Scrabble](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble). Players can't see each other's tiles until they're placed on the board, and the only way to make a new word is to branch off one that already exists. You can't just add gibberish with tiles you don't have on an empty section of the board...and if you do, I'm *totally* not playing with you anymore.\n\nProjects using ZK-Rollups:\n\n* [Aztec 2.0](https://aztec.network)\n* [Hermez Network](https://hermez.io)\n* [Loopring](https://loopring.org)\n* [Matter Labs zkSync](https://zksync.io)\n* [Starkware](https://starkware.co)\n* [zkTube](https://zktube.io)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nL1 and L2 solutions *do* offer great ways to approach scaling. However, the true benefits are realized when they are used in conjunction.\n\nA perfect example of this duality are the many changes involved on the road to [ETH 2.0](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2) which include consensus changes, the addition of the [Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain), and sharding ability. These upgrades prime Ethereum's L1 to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the various L2 solutions we covered earlier in this article.\n\n*How* exactly the ETH 2.0 upgrades work to better-serve L2 scaling solutions totally warrants a separate article altogether, but hopefully our adventure thus far has served to bring the massive potential a bit more into focus.\n\n---\n\nThe journey doesn’t end here! Stay tuned to the MSQ Blog where we’ll be exploring more technical topics just like this one, including a closer look at **Rollups**.\n\nLet us know if there are topics you’d like to learn more about too.

While Ethereum may be the hegemon in the DeFi space, there are other platforms and protocols being developed on other promising ecosystems that hope to resolve some of the longstanding issues within Decentralized Finance. Allow me to introduce Apricot Finance, a next-gen lending protocol built on Solana...***\n\n## A New Kid on the Block\n\nI may have been born in the late '80s and missed the debut of [New Kids on the Block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kids_on_the_Block) in 1984, but it doesn't mean I can't appreciate their contributions to Pop Culture in general. I mean, who could forget hits like *Tonight,* *You Got It (The Right Stuff)* and of course, the inimitable *Step by Step*? Not me, that's for sure!\n\nOK, I'll level with you...I can't say I really know NKOTB (sorry Donnie!) all that well. Me? I'm more of a [Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marky_Mark_and_the_Funky_Bunch) kinda guy. Man was 1991 a great year to be alive! The USSR pretty much broke up, Operation Desert Storm kicked into high gear, and of course, [Mark Wahlberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Wahlberg)'s stone cold Hip-Hop project saw the light of day. What I wouldn't give for an original copy of *Music for the People*, I tell you...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jcGmFIz.jpg)\n\n> Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a picture of this guy with a shirt on?\n\nOh right, you aren't here for trivia about musical projects of yesteryear that happen to feature one of the Wahlbergs. Forgive me, I just can't help but feel nostalgic, ya know? Although I'm not sure nostalgia is really all it's cracked up to be. See, not everything you used to think was 'cool' and 'hip' is anymore...and maybe it was never all that great in the first place (I'm not hating on the Wahlbergs by the way). 56k dial-up modems, telex, DVDs (feel old yet?) and fax machines (which have never been cool) all served a purpose once, and for a time they were the cutting edge of modern technology. Funny, isn't it, that in a few short years, these once coveted technological marvels have become largely or completely obsolete? Ah, the transience of time...\n\nSee, this principle doesn't just apply to music or culture or IT, no, no. In fact, it's pretty far-reaching and all-encompassing. Given the accelerated pace at which tech is developing, technologies can be supplanted virtually overnight if uptake and buy-in is great enough. Now, that DeFi protocol you've been using...how's it working out for you? Maybe you've had an awesome experience and made a ton of cash— more power to you! Or maybe, just maybe, it's been a bit more 'complicated' for you and things haven't gone as well as you would have hoped.\n\nPerhaps it's just bad luck, or maybe some earlier DeFi protocols just have a few unfortunate aspects that make them inefficient or less attractive: liquidity issues, impermanent loss, smart contract vulnerabilities...the list goes on and on. Accessibility and adoption depend largely on user-friendliness and protection, so if protocols consistently fail to address the very real concerns of their audiences, their longevity is far from assured...\n\nThe old is inevitably replaced by the new, and the more efficient, convenient and effective supplants the obsolete, redundant and impractical. That's just the way the system works, and in DeFi, there are a few new kids on the block...and [Apricot Finance](https://apricot.one/) is one of them.\n\n## Talkin' 'Bout My (New) Generation\n\n'Next-gen' was once just a buzzword that game developers and the like slapped onto their releases to build hype and sell their not-so-next-gen wares to the unsuspecting public. However, with the advent of truly revolutionary tech and software such as [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5), 'next-gen' is finally here.\n\nNow while it may not be a blockbuster game with high-end graphics, Apricot Finance is, for all intents and purposes, a next-gen DeFi platform. How can they claim such a thing, you may ask? Well, firstly, their protocol is built on top of [Solana](https://solana.com/), the very same Blockchain platform the much anticipated [Star Atlas](https://staratlas.com/) calls home. It's no secret that Solana is a major player in the cryptosphere and arguably one of the fastest growing ecosystems at present. It promises to be 'low cost forever' as well as 'fast forever,' not to mention highly scalable and fully decentralized. That definitely sounds like a winning combination to me.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ovz1W5p.png)\n\nOf course, being built on Solana doesn't make Apricot Finance truly revolutionary or next-gen on its own. Naturally, a good portion of the real magic comes from the mechanics of the protocol itself. Simply put, Apricot is divided into three interconnected parts or products, namely **Lend**, **X-Farm** and **Assist**. However, before we dive deeper, Apricot just released their [testnet](https://test.apricot.one/), and if you ask me, the interface looks super slick and ultra streamlined.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UVCIwXe.png)\n\n> I'm sure I recognize those mesmerizing colors from somewhere...\n\nSo without further ado, let's check out each of Apricot's products in turn. First up, there's **Apricot Lend**, which, as you might have guessed, involves lending and borrowing. *Lend* serves as Apricot's base layer protocol that allows you to deposit select cryptoassets to earn interest. In addition, you can borrow from Apricot's platform and use your deposited assets as collateral. Now none of this is particularly remarkable, but the real difference with Apricot is that they are *cross-margin*, meaning you can deposit *any* assets, including LP tokens, in order to gain borrowing power. Freedom of choice anybody?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FrBa2M4.png)\n\nNow where things really start to get interesting is in Apricot's second product, namely **Apricot Cross-Farm (X-Farm)**. As Apricot themselves put it, 'cross-margin farming is a logical extension for a lending protocol,' and in all truth, it really is a mystery why nobody else has made any real attempts to go this route in the past. Perhaps the best part of *X-Farm* is that it allows users to start leveraged yield farming without ever having to actually own any of the underlying tokens. Normal yield farming takes place by using a stablecoin pair (such as USDC-USDT). What this means is that users have to convert their cryptoassets into those particular stablecoins and subsequently pool them.\n\nThe difference with *X-Farm* is that users can deposit non-stablecoin cryptoassets as collateral and borrow *both* with up to 3x leverage. In other words, no conversion is necessary, optimizing the process and allowing users a higher degree of control over their cryptoassets (not to mention peace of mind). After both stablecoins have been borrowed, they will be auto-pooled and consequently staked for Liquidity Provider (LP) Tokens, leading to 3x farming yields. The great news with *Apricot X-Farm* is that it encourages borrowing within the platform which results in a higher deposit rate, thus leading to more deposits.\n\n> **Please note:** At present *X-farm* only supports stablecoin LP pairs in order to negate the risk of impermanent loss\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/H1oG55G.png)\n\nOf course, DeFi, and in particular yield farming, isn't exactly a risk-free business. Heck, even some of the most experienced and savvy DeFi users find it time-consuming and strenuous to effectively manage their positions. Although *X-Farm* is awesome at increasing users' access to additional yield without requiring them to sell any assets, there's still the big L-word that every DeFi user fears when it comes to leverage: **Liquidation**. And this is where Apricot's third and final offering comes in...\n\nDon't like being liquidated, do ya? Nobody does, unless you're some kind of maniacal money masochist. Anyway, one of the worst feelings is being watched, especially by the nefarious scourge of liquidators, all salivating and wringing their greedy hands at the thought of depriving you of your hard-earned collateral the *instant* your position dips underwater. It's great to make money, but users need sleep, and they need to have some kind of safety net in place. Arguably the most innovative part of Apricot's overall value proposition is **Apricot Assist**, 'an automated self-deleveraging assistant' (fancy, no?) that you can carefully configure to aid you in reducing your account's leverage with your specific risk profile in mind.\n\nSo in principle, *Apricot Assist* gives you control over three different aspects:\n\n- **When** to sell or begin redeeming your collateral assets,\n- **What** assets should be sold or redeemed, and\n- **How much** of your chosen assets should be sold or redeemed\n\nSo imagine the following scenario: You decide to open a 3x leverage USDT-USDC LP position against your SOL and leave it overnight. Unfortunately, due to some unforeseen circumstance, the price of SOL falls substantially while you sleep. But you anticipated this possibility, (which is exactly why you slept soundly) and used *Apricot Assist* to take care of any less-than-desirable eventualities by configuring the following:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oKx5F64.png)\n\nIn essence, *Apricot Assist* ensures the 'borrow limit used' decreases to 90% and thus well within the realms of safety. As a result, all of your initial SOL principal is kept intact, and the overall size of your USDC-USDT LP position is similarly decreased since a lower leverage ratio means reduced rewards.\n\n*Apricot Assist* is fully programmable and will trigger in the event of any unfortunate circumstances, automatically managing your risk and maintaining your positions in your absence. In periods of high market volatility (which in crypto is something of a regular occurrence), *Apricot Assist* means that you can avoid liquidation all together.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JYVM7H0.png)\n\n## Kick Out the Jams!\n\nGreater freedom and peace of mind through innovative tools that do a lot of the heavy lifting for you, and the ability to more easily avoid liquidation are enough to qualify Apricot Finance as a next-gen DeFi platform. However, this isn't the end of the story...not yet at least. Here's a couple of major benefits I just have to highlight for you:\n\n- If a given user deposits **LP tokens** (which cannot be borrowed on Apricot's platform), Apricot will *auto-farm* for them. LP tokens grant users borrowing power which effectively allows them to farm stablecoin pairs\n- Users can also deposit **stablecoins** and get up to 3x leverage in order to farm stablecoin LP pairs, meaning that rewards can be earned simultaneously from both Apricot and Automated Market Makers (AMMs)\n- Finally, users can deposit **non-stable tokens** such as SOL or BTC (which isn't actually an option in other leveraged yield farming protocols as collateral) to leverage yield farm. As long as users ensure that they use *Apricot Assist* according to Apricot's specifications, there is little to no chance that their principal balance of SOL, BTC or other non-stable token will be negatively affected\n\nTo me, this all sounds like one thing...a winning combination! No matter what kind of cryptoassets you deposit, you receive some kind of borrowing power or benefit. While other protocols are bound by stringent limitations and overly technical interfaces, Apricot Finance has created an intuitive, open and, best of all, *intelligent* lending protocol. Now that's something to get excited about!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dHJa5CM.gif)\n\n> I'm all for extended metaphors, especially if synchronized dancing's involved...\n\n## You Got It (The Right Stuff)\n\n(See what I did there?) Apricot Finance may be new to the DeFi space, but having received $800,000 in initial seed funding and a further $4 million in their latest financing round, it's pretty clear they mean business. And when I say business, I mean taking the DeFi industry to the Dry Cleaners and getting every stain, wrinkle and fold out of every single suit in record time. Now if that ain't service, I don't know what is...\n\nSolana definitely boasts some truly impressive projects, and Apricot Finance is no exception. These guys have their own style, their own moves, and, who knows? They could very well be the next big thing in the world of DeFi. In any case, their offering isn't some cheap copy-paste of another protocol or a ham-fisted cash grab. Nope, this is DeFi done right with a profoundly more focused approach to the very specific needs of end users, and that's something we here at MSQ are very much behind.\n\nIt's little wonder why Apricot made the cut for this edition of ***DeFi Spotlight***. I gotta say, the more I find out about these protocols, the more excited I get about the future of DeFi. And am I sure glad to be part of this unstoppable shift towards a decentralized global economy! With this much momentum propelling them forward, I can say without hesitation that Apricot Finance is poised to make an invaluable addition to the DeFi industry, and I have no doubt their contributions will be substantial indeed.\n\n> This won't be the last you'll be hearing about **Apricot Finance**. I'll be sure to keep up with their progress and continue to bring you all the latest insights in the ever-evolving world of Decentralized Finance. Till next time!",

Whether it's their amazing artwork, vibrant communities or the unique features planned for their projects, there is definitely something here to grab your attention. Today we bring you the Goons of Balatroon!***\n\n## Bair or Bula?\n\nOla amigos! Welcome to another unmissable Discovery of the Day! If you're into crypto, or just trading in general, there's little doubt that you're already familiar with the concept of Bears and Bulls. Whether you think the markets are going to tank or you're ready for that trip to the moon, we all act like goons at times, right? And there's nothing wrong with that (from time to time).\n\nNow the [Goons of Balatroon](https://www.getagoon.com/), they're a crazy bunch— consisting of some 9,696 Bairs (Bears) and Bulas (Bulls) on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain, these two wild and warring clans are pitted against each other in an epic struggle for supremacy over the wild ecosystem of Balatroon. Why, just take a look at the map of the Goons' world...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IKcDibN.jpg)\n\n> You know, that Mt. Xog place looks mighty familiar...\n\nSo how are Goons created? Well, here's the tech version their [FAQ](https://www.getagoon.com/faq/) offers up:\n\n> *Each Goon was created by time algorithms, generated by combining several properties and randomizing rarities in several categories. These rarities include clothing items, jewelry, and facial features*\n\n> **You can click [here](https://www.getagoon.com/faq/) for the , uh, 'non-tech' version...**\n\nHmmm, how to summarize the intricate and zany story behind the Goons of Balatroon? I'm not kidding, I can't actually do this narrative justice in such a short article, but let's just say there lived two brilliant scientists among the Great Species, one Dr. Rev Regor, a member of the Bull Faction, and his partner, a Bear named Dr. Otomakan. To cut to the chase, one extremely dumb Bull (*name redacted*) accidentally discovers time travel, Otomakan and Regor have a fight, and the two wind up 9,696 years in the past, 200 years before the Great Eruption of Mt. Balatroon. Oh, and it doesn't end there. Glancing over a few key details, the Goons of Dr. Otomakan and those of Dr. Rev Regor are engaged in an all-out brutal conflict. The question is: which side will you support, dear crypto Goon? You Bair? Or Bula!?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8dK6Wh4.png)\n\n> [Dr. Rev Regor](https://www.getagoon.com/gallery/5-dr-rev-regor/) looking fresh and ready for the fight...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gCsintZ.png)\n\n> [Dr. Otomakan](https://www.getagoon.com/gallery/4-dr-otomakan/) is noted for his signature Jedi Robes and charming taxidermy smile\n\nSo who's the artist behind the Goons of Balatroon? From their official website, it seems that the father of the Goons, as it were, is none other than award-winning illustrator [Aniket Trivedi](https://twitter.com/aniketunder666). We see your creations Aniket and we totally love them!\n\n![](youtube:3YD5P_47hpo)\n\n> Check out Episode 1 of Goons of Balatroon\n\n## What's Next for Goons of Balatroon?\n\nThere's plenty planned for the Goons of Balatroon. Their [Roadmap](https://www.getagoon.com/roadmap/) is divided into three sections, namely **Community**, **Expansion** and **Gaming**.\n\n- Under *Community* there's the promise of more comics and cartoons, $TROON Token launches along with an airdrop of 1,000 tokens per NFT and $25,000 towards a fund for *(To Be Confirmed)*\n- Under *Expansion*, every single Goon owner will be able to generate a custom, totally unique full-body character for their avatar. In addition, an expansion of the Gallery and Members pages is planned, and each Goon will receive an airdrop of 40 cards to be used in-game (so 40 NFTs per Goon!)\n- Finally, under *Gaming* we find the release of Battle of Balatroon v1.0, the ability to craft new cards using the $TROON token (which is much the same as breeding) and the first full season of the animated Goons of Balatroon series on YouTube! Wow!\n\nThe above is just a selection of what's planned on the Goons of Balatroon. See more for yourself below, or just click the link above...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xkjZvA4.jpg)\n\n> That seems like one detailed Roadmap to me!\n\n## Statistics\n\n* **Total Items** - 9,696\n* **Owners** - 3.5K\n* **Floor Price** - 0.2 ETH\n* **Volume Traded** - 2.5K ETH\n\nThe collection is currently sold out, but you can view the Goons over here on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/goonsofbalatroon).

      "body": "***Dungeon Crawler-style Role-Playing Games (RPGs) burst onto the scene in the '90s. Inspired by [Dungeons & Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/) (D&D), using randomly generated environments, character skill sets, and at the center of it all...Loot. Non-Fungible Token (NFT) based games built on Blockchain have created new possibilities for the future of gaming. One game recently caught my attention, and it combines one of my favorite styles of games, Dungeon Crawlers, with the digital ownership aspects of Blockchain! You know I needed to check this out for myself. So, use a town portal, and 'Stay awhile and listen.' This...is [Lost Relics](https://lostrelics.io/).***\n\n## Greetings Warrior!\n\nDungeon Crawlers were first introduced to me when I was 9 years old with the release of [Diablo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_(video_game)) by [Blizzard Entertainment](https://www.blizzard.com/) in January 1997. Even at that young age, I was already a hardcore fanboy of *Blizzard* games, after hundreds of hours spent playing [Warcraft: Orcs & Humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft:_Orcs_%26_Humans) and its sequel [Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_II:_Tides_of_Darkness).\n\nI remember anxiously waiting for my mom to finish her morning routine so she could take me to buy a new game with the unlimited money I got from the recent Christmas holiday. Well...I had like, $75 dollars. So, like I said: unlimited funds! After what seemed like an eternity, mom was ready, and we left to purchase what would soon become my favorite game franchise (and genre) of all time: *Diablo*.\n\nI honestly had no idea what it even was and hadn't gone for it specifically, but the dark cover art, and just the fact it was made by *Blizzard*...I **had** to have it!\n\n![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61MhW9taUdL._SL1092_.jpg)\n\n> Just look at it: the simple, clean, menacing imagery **still** looks amazing!\n\nLooking back, she probably shouldn't have bought it for me considering [The Entertainment Software Rating Board](https://www.esrb.org/) (ESRB) gave it an M for mature, but that was a relatively new thing at the time. Yeah, I know, I'm old. Nevertheless, she did, and I had managed to lay my hands on a game that would soon become a lifelong passion, and one I still play to this day.\n\n## The Loot Greed is *Real!*\n\nSome of you might be wondering what a Dungeon Crawler even is, just as I did when *Diablo* came into my life. Dungeon Crawlers, originally called 'Hack and Slash,' are RPGs that traditionally feature a medieval setting with a top-down view similar to Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games. They center around the rewards (or loot) you gain by killing monsters, creatures, demons, and whatever else you can possibly think of.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FcmA9YI.jpg)\n\n> The *Balrogs* from [Diablo 2](https://diablo2.blizzard.com/) are firebreathing demons that can quickly end your quest before you even notice, especially if you get surrounded\n\nWhat really makes *Diablo* special is its replay value. At the time, single player games were generally built around telling an intriguing and immersive story, and playing them again and again wasn't actually part of the mechanic. Having said this, some games did offer small incentive bonuses for second or third playthroughs, but **nothing** like this.\n\nThe experience of the game is the replay— it's the thrill of the hunt for loot combined with endlessly needing to stop *Diablo, the Lord of Terror,* from unleashing the demons of Hell into our world. I don't know about you, but this was more than enough for me. Each game you start off with always feel new and exciting since dungeon sequences or maps are randomly generated using a coding algorithm called 'Procedurally Generated Environments.' So no matter how many times you visit the 'Catacombs Level 2' fast travel waypoint, it always feels new, because it is!\n\n*Diablo* weaved a careful balance of story and replay value. While not as detailed as some other games of the time, the basic narrative is more than enough when paired with the built-in mechanic of needing new randomly determined loot drops. Oh, did I mention the added bonus of increased difficulties only playable with better loot? Well, that's also a feature, and this allows you to find even better...you guessed it— loot! Pure replay genius!\n\n![](https://www.gamersdecide.com/sites/default/files/content-images/news/2017/07/07/legendary-farming-10-tricks-and-tips/legendary-beams-galore.jpg)\n\n> That's...a lot of legendary loot. *Diablo 3* made missing good loot nearly impossible. In the first game, you would have no idea whether a legendary or unique item had dropped\n\nIt was also the first instance of a game I personally played using a system that would eventually be known as the 'The Grind,' a word used to describe how much time a progression system of an RPG's mechanics will take. Today this system is utilized in a variety of ways by most types of games. Even First Person Shooter (FPS) games have adopted progression systems, but for me, it was *Diablo* that first introduced 'The Grind.'\n\n## A Blockchain Dungeon Crawler!?\n\nWith the recent introduction of [MSQ Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjqDD3L3HjOTFRdc9H_-Pig) (which you should definitely check out and subscribe to), I find myself with probably the greatest job in the world for a passionate gamer involved with Blockchain— I get to research, play, and report on Blockchain games while getting to participate in a weekly scheduled stream every Wednesday and Friday from 9-11 AM EST.\n\nThis has led me to embrace a new world of digital ownership-based games that I might never have found on my own. While looking for potential games to stream, I stumbled upon one I simply couldn't resist trying out. This is a Dungeon Crawling, NFT-based, Play-to-Earn game developed by [Codebit Labs](https://codebitlabs.com/) on the [Enjin](https://enjin.io/) network which operates as a layer-2 solution on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain called, *Lost Relics*.\n\n![](https://nftplazas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lostrelicsblockchaingame.jpg)\n\n> The hours spent in this game and community weren't just for fun! It was research, OK? I **love** this game! It isn't work at all... \n\nAfter seeing a handful of images and reading about the concept, I couldn't wait to try *Lost Relics* out. Normally, I wait to do a breakdown of games that have potential after streaming them, saving the new experience in an attempt to showcase the confusion that can arise when trying to play Blockchain games. This time, however, I just couldn't wait. I can play and get randomly generated items from enemies that can be minted almost entirely in-game? **SOLD!**\n\nI did what I had to do. I installed the game and spent **hours** playing and learning. I quickly came to the conclusion that, in my opinion, *Lost Relics* is one of best transitions from a mainstream game format to a Blockchain game. An NFT-based version of a Dungeon Crawler that is **almost** perfect, and it's still in Alpha...its *Alpha!*\n\n## Accessing the World of Lost Relics \n\nEager to start my dungeon crawling, I headed to the *Lost Relics* website and clicked the 'Download' link. An account is required to initiate the download process, so I quickly set one up. However, I was informed that, in order to download a copy of the Alpha release, I'd have to purchase a 'Power Pendant,' or wait until the Beta released, which I was...definitely not going to do.\n\nThe website explains that 'Power Pendants' act as a limited-time subscription of sorts, unlocking special perks for your account until they run out. The times range from 1 to 90 days, with prices increasing with every level. Without hesitation, I opted for the 30 day pass. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SWSDuDe.png)\n\n> Yeah, I should have bought the 90 day— I. **LOVE**. This game.\n\nThere was a time when new users weren't required to purchase anything to access the game, but this is no longer the case. Nevertheless, I was late to this RPG party, so I had to pay. But before I could make any kind of purchase, I had to link my *Enjin* wallet to my newly created *Lost Relics* account, which was thankfully a simple process.\n\nOnce linked, my account was activated, thereby confirming my purchase and allowing me access to *Lost Relics*. Note that I already had an *Enjin* wallet set up from my previous [adventure](https://MSQ.io/projects/MSQ/blog/preview-the-six-dragons-beta), exploring [The Six Dragons](https://thesixdragons.com/). \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EhDY6Iq.png)\n\n> Check out the Preview on [MSQ](http://www.MSQ.io/)\n\n*The Lost Relics* was easy to install— most of the games I have tested so far (still in their Beta) have been complicated or confusing to install, but thankfully, this time was different.\n\nSo with a double click of the newly installed shortcut, into the world I went. Developer videos soon filled the screen followed by an explosion of the *Lost Relics* logo. Awesome! It transitioned to the login section that automatically logged me in, presenting the character screen. Wow!\n\nSeriously though, as dumb as it sounds, that's actually a big deal with some of the games I have tested lately: no extra hoops, no confirming email notification three times, nothing to do...just play the game— and that's exactly what I did.\n\n## Talmuth Awaits!\n\nI entered my new domain of Talmuth. The familiar overhead view employed by countless Dungeon Crawlers before it greeted me. It didn't have the standard bubble or orb style health and mana indicators, but these were easily identified with the standard item bar and skill slots visible.\n\nTo the north-east of me lay a cave entrance, but before I ventured forth into the unknown, I first decided to see what the key mapping was in relation to previous games. To my satisfaction, almost all of them were familiar to me. A notable exception is the [Q] key which allows you to swap from ranged to melee weapons.\n\nI then hit [M] to bring up my map, revealing words paired with matching icons that simply explained themselves— a blacksmith with an anvil, a stove with meat, alchemy with a vial, and so on.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gLNYiPD.jpg)\n\n> A common sight for weary adventurers. Even without the simple descriptions, they're pretty obvious. Good job!\n\nIgnorant of the dangers that lay ahead and filled with enthusiasm to start, I headed towards the cave. This brought up a screen to select what Dungeon Level I wanted to experience. Each level increases in difficulty, showcasing different varieties of enemies as well as different resources to be gathered.\n\n![](youtube:6gzhyu0Bl7g)\n\n> The list of dungeons available. This was very recently updated from the six I originally had to choose from\n\nAfter choosing the first one, a warning screen informed me that if I died while in a dungeon, I would lose all my items not saved to the Blockchain, as well as any experience (EXP) or gold I had acquired. Pfft! I won't die, I'm a veteran of these games! And so I entered the Level One dungeon...\n\n## Out of the Frying Pan and Into the Fire\n\nI warped into what looked like a castle cellar, similar to early levels in *Diablo 1*. Confidently, I pressed through the opening door. A pair of noises told me I had alerted two enemies that were now on their way to attack. A big-headed skeleton and a hulking mummy-like enemy soon appeared. I held the shift key to get into the appropriate stance and fired a volley of arrows at them. Each only required three to four arrows before dying and rewarded me with a meager 3-5 EXP.\n\nAs I progressed through the dungeon, encountering skeletons, boars, ghosts, and weird little guys that reminded me of *Pinkies* from [DOOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(franchise)), they slowly started to chip away at my 3,000 fixed Hit Points (HP). I sluggishly tried to swap weapons while maintaining my primary as ranged attacks, but before I knew it, I was dead. Hmm...Maybe I should learn more.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OkO6bIG.jpg)\n\n> Take too much damage, and you're done. 3,000 Health is all you get, regardless of level\n\nI respawned in town, defeated, and low. I didn't actually lose any items upon dying because I...hadn't collected any. To lift my spirits, I decided to head to town and do some exploring. I found a marketplace called the 'Royale Emporium' where items ranging from 'Common' to 'Transcendent' can be purchased and sold between players.\n\nSomething that sets *Lost Relics* apart is that the game provides you with the option to change the item marketplace from 'Virtual' to 'Blockchain.' 'Virtual' items can be purchased with in-game gold, and while these items are generally cheaper, they can be lost if you end up dying. Items from the 'Blockchain' section are minted NFTs created by paying a small fee to move any 'Uncommmon' or above item to the 'Blockchain' market (this is all explained through an easy to access link on the website).\n\n'Blockchain' items can only be bought using 'Shadowstones,' a resource acquired through converting *Enjin* tokens or by selling your 'Blockchain' items. 'Blockchain' items are NFTs paired to your account, meaning that if you die while using them, unlike 'Virtual' items, they won't be deleted. Simply put, you keep them stored in your Enjin wallet forever until you want to sell or trade them.\n\n![](youtube:jzCG053cSRI)\n\n> The 'Virtual' and 'Blockchain' marketplace. Both accept two different currencies, Gold and Shadowstones...I must have both!\n\n## A Quest Awaits!\n\nI next visited the 'Tavern', quickly realizing it was the spot to be. It was full of players standing idle or running around. As I walked in, an NPC spoke telling me about the weekly raffle for a high quality item. I walked to the left and attempted to buy a ticket for the raffle but obviously lacked the funds to do so. I moved on and explored the area, finding a few places to equip hats, and eventually discovered a stairwell that led me to my private room and stash.\n\n![](youtube:3y-Moz1MDBM)\n\n> A recent purchase of a raffle ticket. Easy, and hopefully mine in a week...\n\n![](youtube:OfdaDy3nz9o)\n\n> Personal stash that you must visit to deposit and collect anything you buy or find\n\nHere's a quick tip: make sure that, before leaving your private stash area, you enter the room next to yours that has a book on the bed for a nice surprise. I then left the tavern and was greeted by a new NPC that had...a Quest! Naturally, I skipped everything he said (I know, calm down, I got this). As I suspected, the quest requirements appeared on the lower right-hand side of the game screen: 'Complete any dungeon.' Get some!\n\nI started to head out, but then a player with a dragon following him ran by me. I stopped in my tracks and followed him, admiring this fun pet that was all-too familiar from past games. Where did this impressive beast come from? And, more importantly, how do I get one?\n\nI decided to enter the chat, unsure if anyone would even acknowledge me. I quickly realized this community was welcoming, encouraging, and constantly giving each other tips. My question was answered right away, and followed-up with a barrage of tips and tricks other players had learned.\n\nHaving my answer and then some, I stopped by the marketplace, purchased a pet dragon, hit the stash, equipped my new companion and headed to the dungeons. I was officially ready for my rematch!\n\n## The Only Way Back is Forward\n\nI reached the dungeon selection cave and started Level One again. Here we go. The same settings were in play, but an entirely new dungeon layout appeared thanks to the randomly generated environments built into the game. Cautiously, I moved deeper into the dungeon. Keeping my distance, I cleared room after room, sustaining only minor damage.\n\nIt was then that I noticed something amazing— my dragon was actively seeking out destructibles that sometimes contained gold or loot drops, and collecting them for me! Corners containing vases or boxes that I couldn't see were revealed as my pet charged, broke and sometimes collected from each one. This was something I had been completely unaware of until now. If you're going to play this game, get yourself a pet! Some types are very limited in supply, so act now to avoid disappointment!\n\nAnyway, I reached the final room and found a large chest along with a few boxes. While I opened the chest, my pet did its thing, and I proceeded through the exit and back to town. I had completed the quest and was awarded a green bow that deals **twice** the damage of the one I had been using. I quickly equipped it and re-entered the cave. I know my stuff now...I am the Destroyer!\n\nI tried to enter a Level One dungeon and was denied since my item rating was too high. Obviously that would be the case, and without thinking, I started dungeon Level Two. I opened the door and was greeted by entirely new (as well as larger and more menacing) enemies. I managed to kill them quickly with my bow, but they had seriously whittled down my Health. ***Oh no!***\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oAA4EnI.jpg)\n\n> Not the same scenario, but a similar Health situation, this time with more at stake: my bow...\n\nI had barely cleared 3 rooms, and was under 1,000 HP. Desperately, I turned back to the entrance. With no way out, I remembered, 'you need to find an exit, or you lose your items' (or item, in my case). Nevertheless, my situation was dire— I was going to die. So I accepted my fate and, like the 'Light Brigade,' blundering and proud, marched into the next room and was immediately consumed by my enemies...\n\n## My Last Lost Relic\n\nI respawned in the usual place in town. Quickly scanning my equipment bar, I realized— I had lost my first item of value, just moments after acquiring it. This deepened my understanding of just how seriously prepared you need to be before entering a dungeon. Even at low levels I can now easily complete, I bring more than enough food in anticipation of worst-case scenarios. If you die, you won't technically lose your starting Uncommon weapons, but you will lose your equipment item used to harvest specific resources in each dungeon. That is, if you have one.\n\nA cool trick I learned for practically unlimited free food is to head to the general store and buy four pots, each costing 1 gold. Then head to the well adjacent to it and fill each pot with water. Next, head to the alchemy station at the windmill and move south to the flour sacks, grabbing 4 of them. Finally, go to the cooking station and attempt to create 4 loaves of bread. You can refill the pots and grab more free flour to repeat this process. Boom. Food stocks means surviving dungeons...usually.\n\nMy journey with *Lost Relics* has only just begun. I played enough to unlock player rewards and have hours of dungeons completed at this point. This is by far my favorite Blockchain game I have played to-date and the one I've spent the most time with.\n\nI've learned tons of things from the community and game. If you want to see more in-depth information on *Lost Relics,* check out our video on [MSQ Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjqDD3L3HjOTFRdc9H_-Pig) where I dive deeper into explaining the basics as well as specific strategies, future plans, and community chatter.\n\nSo if you're a dungeon crawler like me, sign up now or wait for the Beta. Either way, make sure you join the adventure that is NFT hunting in *Lost Relics*. I hope to see you out there soon. You know the name, and I will always try to help. Happy hunting adventurers!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2NAxVEI.jpg)",

      "slug": "understanding-nfts-and-the-value-they-hold-over-us",
      "body": "***NFTs are everywhere, and while many question their utility and value, it's evident that they're here to stay. However, what is it about Non-Fungible Tokens that has so many people scrambling to buy as many as they possibly can? The psychology of modern humans is highly nuanced, but nevertheless, a careful analysis should shed some light on the matter...***\n\nNFTs burst into mainstream culture this summer, and in spite of doubts that they’d be the next crypto trend to fade into obscurity after fifteen minutes of fame, it's safe to say their relevance will persist into the fall and beyond.\n\nThe collections that have caught most people’s attention have done so with their prices— [Cryptopunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), [Bored Apes](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/) and [Pudgy Penguins](https://www.pudgypenguins.io/#/) amassed sales incomprehensible to anyone outside of the crypto space, and even to many inside of it. With their popularity has come speculation as to why they hold value in the first place. The answer to this question can shed light on the future of the cryptocurrency space as a whole, and even the humanity of the people interacting with it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EhssBVh.jpg)\n\n> He may be cute, but with a floor price of 2.25 ETH, Pudgy Penguins is currently one of the top NFT projects in the cryptosphere\n\n## Digital Prestige\n\nAs someone who’s been observing the NFT space for the past year, there’s one value proposition that NFTs undoubtedly deliver— *prestige*. Look no further than the 10,000 unit PFP trend as evidence.\n\nThe utility of owning a Bored Ape, for example, goes beyond seeing its image in your OpenSea dashboard. In the cryptocurrency community, owning an expensive NFT gives you clout and popularity where it matters most— Twitter. A Bored Ape profile picture will lead to a massive follower boost overnight, and even owning a cheaper NFT from an up-and-coming community like [Lazy Lions](https://www.lazylionsnft.com/) or [SupDucks](https://www.supducks.com/) can boost your engagement. The idea of celebrity status has always been in the context of its domain, and as our culture continues to live more and more online, for some, having status on Twitter becomes more important than in the physical world.\n\nThe trend of NFT profile pictures taps into some of the deepest instincts we possess as humans— the desire for social status and hierarchy. Even in communities like Crypto Twitter, where anonymity plays a central role, these instincts take center stage.\n\nThe extrapolation many make, of course, is to the metaverse. In a world without physical representations of status and wealth, how will people show off social status? Many believe that NFTs are the beginning of a digital class divide.\n\n## The Allure of Fine Art\n\nWhen explaining the concept of an NFT to someone outside the crypto space, many use the comparison to art. Yes, it’s just a JPEG, but it’s *my* JPEG. We’ve all heard the line about printing out a picture of the [Mona Lisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa), but I believe that the comparison between NFTs and fine art is more complex than physicality.\n\n![](twitter:day25/status/1439825974204325888)\n\nNFTs are no longer just a rival to fine art from a conceptual standpoint. With sales from venerable auction houses like Christie’s and Sotheby’s, they stand next to, and even above, traditional paintings that sell for millions of dollars and are stored in private art collections.\n\nNFTs possess the allure of fine art foremost because of the narratives behind them. Take Cryptopunks as an example. In 2017, before anyone really knew about NFTs or the power they would one day hold over us, the CryptoPunks were created merely as an experiment. Initially given away for free, they’re now selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars, because they capture a moment in history impossible to replicate years later.\n\nFor the same reason a Picasso can have value because of the era it was created in, the value of a Punk extends beyond its visual appeal. After all, the price of fine art is not determined by a consensus on how nice it would look to hang on the wall. It’s determined by the notoriety of its artist, the sales of their other works, and its rarity in context. The same criteria holds true for NFTs.\n\n## Understanding the Pushback\n\nThis exploration of NFTs and their value has been tinctured with optimism, but there are definitely viable concerns about the future of the space. The most threatening aspect of the current NFT market is the desire for profit, and collections that neither the creators, buyers nor sellers enter with intentions beyond making a quick buck. If NFTs are to hold value in the long-term, they need to be made with utility and authenticity in mind. Some collections are doing a great job of this, but the ones that aren’t are really hurting the space.\n\nThe volatility of NFTs makes it distinct from holding value in the same way fine art does. I’d sleep better at night owning a [Van Gogh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh) than an equivalent amount of Fidenzas, for reasons obvious enough I don’t need to state them. As the space continues to mature, however, I think that volatility will be mitigated for the more established projects, and buying into an NFT community won’t have the risk of crashing in the same way it does today.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Q9Qppdh.gif)\n\n> Well, it's a little more complicated than that...\n\nUltimately, the reason many people discredit NFTs as valuable is because they are a departure from the familiar. When we think about indicators of status, our minds jump to fancy sports cars, waterfront properties, and Rolex watches. In the same way that cryptocurrency is disrupting the world of traditional finance, NFTs are redefining the way our online presence can hold social status. While their longevity has yet to be determined, the idea of digitized hierarchy is undoubtedly here to stay.",

In this edition, we're checking out a project that's Decentralized Finance (DeFi), marking something of a departure from the 'NFT Only' approach we've been following (Don't worry, there's still plenty of NFTs coming!) So, without further ado, today we bring you Abracadabra.Money!***\n\n## Alakazam, Alakazoo!\n\nThere's nothing quite like the mystic arts and the power of crypto, and there's no debating the fact that we love magic internet money. Ah yes, is there anything more enrapturing and spellbinding than the ever-evolving world of Blockchain tech? I guess with NFTs, DeFi and new Blockchain-based games, we all feel like wizards (or warlocks, or sorceresses...you get the drift) at the best of times. Sure, we might not have long gray beards or help Hobbits and Dwarves out with their quests against a Dark Lord trapped in an enchanted Ring, but we sure know how to generate a good yield (hopefully).\n\n[Abracadabra.Money](https://abracadabra.money/) is a DeFi project that *literally* allows you to produce Magic Internet Money (MIM). It's no longer a goof guys, we have finally reached the apex of our memes. In all seriousness though, Abracadabra.Money actually acts as a 'Spellbook,' thus making its users 'Spellcasters.' As such, you can provide collateral in the form of several interest bearing cryptoassets including yvYFI, yvUSDT, yvUSDC, xSUSHI and more. Users are then able to borrow Magic Internet Money (MIM), a stablecoin that can be swapped for any other traditional stablecoin.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hIqvwUj.png)\n\n> That about summarizes it...\n\nOnce users are done conjuring, the spell is easily reversed by returning the conjured MIMs to the Spellbook. Once this is complete, the magically locked interest bearing tokens are released...simple as that! It's nothing even the least experienced of Druids can't handle.\n\nWhat's also great about Abracadabra.Money is that you can select between five different networks including [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain), [Fantom](https://fantom.foundation/), [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/) and [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/). This multi-chain approach makes Abracadabra.Money far more versatile and attractive to users since they are not at the mercy of any one platform, allowing for greater uptake and easier control over their DeFi experience.\n\n## What Services Does Abracadabra.Money Offer?\n\nWithout getting in to too much detail, the following services are offered by Abracadabra.Money:\n\n- **Borrowing** using Kashi Lending Technology\n- **Farming** whereby users deposit LP tokens to farm SPELL tokens\n- **Staking** whereby SPELL tokens are staked for sSPELL\n- **MIM-3POOL** that allows users to provide liquidity to the MIM-3LP3CRV pool\n- **Swapping** using curve.fi which allows users to swap their MIM stable coins for USDT, DAI, or USDC\n- **Bridging** MIM tokens directly on Abracadabra's interface thanks to [Anyswap Network](https://anyswap.exchange/#/router)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JdxhL1a.png)\n\n> DeFi Dragons emulate Smaug and covet (digital) gold above all else\n\n## What Sorcery is This!?\n\nHaving only been around for what seems like a couple of months, Abracadabra.Money has managed to garner a pretty sizable following on their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MIM_Spell) account, and judging by some of the material I've seen on YouTube, some users seem to think Abracadabra.Money, and MIM token in particular, is truly magic! In fact, according to [Crypto Mischief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7a_Jztq7Lc&t=19s), he swears that MIM is 'the future of DeFi.'\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qqIaupW.png)\n\n> Yes, Magic Woosh Kitty, I doez\n\nWith a straightforward interface, novel approach and growing community, Abracadabra.Money seems like a real player in the DeFi space. Be sure to check their protocol out and follow them on their various social media pages. Until next time crypto fans!\n\n> For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) on SubStack, and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar) on Twitter.\n\n*We will be hosting giveaways on the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) every Friday at 3PM EST.

Whether it's their incredible artwork, vibrant communities or the awesome features planned for their projects, there's sure to be something here that'll grab you. Today we bring you Skullx!***\n\n## From the Depths of Hell\n\nFrom cute cartoon cats and dogs to frightening renderings of ghosts and ghouls, the sheer diversity of styles and collections within the world of NFTs is growing on a daily basis. It's clear that Non-Fungible Tokens are here to stay and that several communities forming around these provably rare collections of digital art are truly committed to supporting (and holding on to) the pieces created by innovative and talented digital artists from around the world.\n\nToday's Discovery of the Day falls into the darker side of the NFT spectrum—[Skullx](https://skullxnft.io/) is a series of collections of digital skulls and outlandish creatures that inhabit the murky underworld of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain.\n\nNow again, I said Skullx is a series of 'collections,' not just one single collection. The first generation of Skullx NFTs belong to the [Skullx: Origins](https://opensea.io/collection/kinkyskullx) collection (otherwise known as 'KinkySkullx'). There are exactly 666 of these colorfully demented, hand generated skulls in existence, and the vast majority of them already have owners. At time of writing, this collection has a floor price of 0.99 ETH, so if you want to get your hands on one, head over to their OpenSea page right now. As an added bonus, holding a Skullx: Origins piece grants you access to a free mint. Check out a sample of this collection below:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AdwPjgr.jpg)\n\n> Greg really wasn't happy with the new marketing direction, but at least sales were up from last Quarter...\n\nThen there's [Skullx: Aeons](https://opensea.io/collection/skullx-aeons). The second generation of Skullx NFTs, Aeons has a suitably more developed backstory and draws from the cosmic horror stylings of notable authors such as [H.P. Lovecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft) and [Thomas Ligotti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Ligotti).\n\nConsisting of some 2,000 pieces, these primordial beings have existed since time immemorial. Denizens of far-flung dimensions, they have spent countless millennia wandering across the Netherverse, protecting their domains and eliminating any who oppose their superiority. Up until recently, these terrifying giants have remained inert in a deep slumber, but disturbances from a troubled past have roused them from their long rest. As such, the fallen Aeons of the Old World have freed themselves from the confines of the Nether and are hungry to reclaim that which was once theirs. At time of writing, Skullx: Aeons has a floor price of 0.26 ETH. Gaze into the eyes of his specimen, if you dare:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iRhsnZ6.jpg)\n\n> This actually reminds me of [SCP-3000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmEZ-zqbswg) (otherwise known as Anantashesha), though I think this gargantuan 'Summoner' is way more terrifying!\n\nNow I'd also like to draw your attention to this very limited edition of Skullx NFTs, or rather a collaborative effort, [MechNuggets x Skullx](https://opensea.io/collection/mechnuggets-x-kinkyskullx). Consisting of eight 3D Mech Skullx summoned from Hell, this expertly rendered collection currently has a floor price of 0.88 ETH. Also, every Skullx: Aeons piece acts as a mint pass, so make sure that, if you own one, you use it before the public sale opens! Here's my favorite piece from the collection:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/glSUBeo.png)\n\n> If the creator(s) of this piece isn't a [Megadeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megadeth) fan, then I don't know...\n\nThe artist behind Skullx is '[666](https://twitter.com/Skullx_666).' Yes, that's literally all I can tell you, but their NFTs are diabolically delightful, if I do say so myself...\n\n## What's Next for Skullx?\n\nI'm glad you asked, because the next collection, **Skullx: 10k**, is due for release sometime in October. As you may have guessed, this new crop consists of 10,000 Skullx that will soon be summoned as ERC-721 tokens to fight for and protect their realms. The lore reveals that a looming darkness of the past, yet to be fully revealed, will change the fate of all. Ominous!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Zs05Bvi.gif)\n\n> I gotta get my mitts on one of these bad boys!\n\nAs for the Roadmap, well, it's not super detailed, but it looks like airdrops, a migration of the Pixel Skullx Contract, the 1st utility of Aeons and the establishment of a SkullxDAO are all on the cards. See for yourself:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qWh69TO.png)\n\n> Nothing wrong with pragmatism!\n\n## Statistics\n\nGiven that Skullx consists of a few collections, the following stats apply to Skullx: Origins.\n\n* **Total Items** - 476/666\n* **Owners** - 137\n* **Floor Price** - 0.99 ETH\n* **Volume Traded** - 161 ETH\n\nThe collection is currently sold out, but you can view Skullx: Origins over here on their [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/kinkyskullx) page. You can also check out [Skullx: Aeons](https://opensea.io/collection/skullx-aeons), [Skullx: Editions](https://opensea.io/collection/skullx-editions) and [MechNuggets x Skullx](https://opensea.io/collection/mechnuggets-x-kinkyskullx) if you'd like to find out more about each individual collection.\n\nAs a fan of darker stuff and Metal, I gotta tell ya, Skullx really floats my boat. With a super active team, growing community and a sick new collection about to drop, Skullx is definitely an NFT project you'll want to follow closely. Have your wallet at the ready so you don't miss out on the next mint!

Whether it's their art, their vibrant communities, or the unique features planned for their projects, there is definitely something here that will catch your eye. Today we bring you Paladin Pandas!**_\n\n## Paladin Panda-monium!\n\n[Paladin Pandas](https://www.paladinpandas.com) is a gamified collection of 10,000 unique ERC-1155 NFTs on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) Blockchain. These playable paladins are hand-drawn and feature over 150 programmatically generated traits across 6 classes and 9 categories. Each panda has its own background story and is ready for battle.\n\nLegend has it, these pandas were bamboo-zled by the old gods. With their home planet destroyed and forced to rebuild, the Panda Elders entrusted only the most elite panda warriors with the task of retrieving their most sacred resource—Bambooniums. The Paladin Pandas travel space scavenging, mining, and raid boss farming, ready to fight for glory!\n\n### Intergalactic Gamification\n\nOne way to battle for rewards is a rogue-like game called, 'Space Expedition' where every adventure is a random map that pits your pandas against evil invaders for a chance to win Bambooniums and other exciting prizes, which is promised to include some very high-profile NFTs! The game is still in development, but the paladin engineering team just released their updated Space Expedition whitepaper to include some pand-tastic new details!\n\nClick the image below or visit [https://shrtco.de/🐼🎮📃](https://shrtco.de/🐼🎮📃) to learn more!\n\n<a href=\"https://shrtco.de/🐼🎮📃\">\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/f2XVNzV/mosaic-cover.jpg)\n\n</div>\n</a>\n\n### Features\n\n* **Asian Inspired & Created** - All Paladin Pandas are carefully crafted by experienced and highly skilled Asian artists\n* **Play-2-Earn** - There are six classes with different skills and an assortment of weapons to choose from\n* **Community First** - Community contributors are rewarded regularly, and numerous community activities and airdrops are currently being planned\n* **Full Ownership** - When you mint a Paladin Panda, you get the full commercial rights to it, so you can reproduce, sell and do pretty much anything you want with it\n* **Wildlife Protection** - A portion of all proceeds received will be donated to animal protection charities for Pandas as well as other endangered wild animals\n\n### Rarity\n\nSome important things to know while building your collection are that rareness and diversity play critical roles in ensuring a successful battle and, consequently, your ability to earn rewards. For instance, having pandas from 3 different classes gives you special in-game advantages (or 'BUFFS,' for the initiated). The more classes you hold, the more skills and positionings you can use, the more enemies you can defeat!\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/tbZsfH6/paladin-pandas.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n----<br>Yeah...did you catch that?<br>There's even a freaking hoverboard! 🤯\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://media2.giphy.com/media/RgbveF92uzZLnBcUQk/giphy.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n* **Fur**\n  * Golden (0.2%)\n  * Alien (1%)\n  * Zombie (3%)\n  * Leopard (6%)\n  * Quick Silver (6%)\n  * Panda (≈83.8%)\n* **Class**\n  * Commando (≈16.7%)\n  * CyberBard (≈16.7%)\n  * Engineer (≈16.7%)\n  * Main Tank (≈16.7%)\n  * Medic (≈16.7%)\n  * Sniper (≈16.7%)\n* **Background**\n  * Graffiti (≈0.6%)\n  * Bamboo (≈1%)\n  * Aquamarine (≈5.8%)\n  * Coral (≈5.8%)\n  * Spring (≈5.8%)\n  * Orange (≈5.8%)\n\n> Note that some of the rarest traits include the Graffiti and Bamboo backgrounds as well as Golden, Zombie, Alien, Leopard, and QuickSilver furs. The Panda Elders have hinted that these are important aspects to keep in mind going forward.\n\n## What's Next for Paladin Pandas?\n\nInitially, 709 out of 10,000 Paladin Pandas will be withheld and airdropped to Genesis Hodlers; 91 out of 10,000 will be withheld for community events and the team, and 200 out of 10,000 will be set aside for prizes within the game.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.paladinpandas.com/#roadmap\">\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xfabdRR.png)\n\n</div>\n</a>\n\n> Click the image above or **[here](https://www.paladinpandas.com/#roadmap)** to view the full Roadmap.\n\n## Stats\n\nThe Paladin Pandas public sale started September 28th at 4 AM PDT...and it sold out in 32 minutes!

Provably rare **JPEGs** of cute, tiny animals of course!\n\nThese indisputably kawaii Axolittles are a collection of 10,000 algorithmically generated pieces of adorable art living in the ocean of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain. Each Axolittle is made up from a random selection of over 160 unique traits. An intriguing feature of the Axolittles is that every single one is fully animated!

Whether it's their incredible artwork, vibrant communities or the awesome features planned for their projects, there's definitely something here to capture your imagination! Today we bring you Frontier!***\n\n## The Path of The Watcher\n\nSent on a secret mission along with a fleet of ships, an enigmatic traveler known only as 'The Watcher S/N 404' soon finds himself alone and lost in the far reaches of space after a mysterious incident occurs. To make matters worse, The International Space Security Administration (ISSA) knows he isn't dead and plans to eliminate him in order to hide the truth...\n\nEnter the world of [Frontier](https://www.missingfrontier.com/), an online Play-to-Earn Battle Royale and our Discovery of the Day! Now the story of The Watcher isn't being decided by any central entity—in fact, you can follow [The Watcher](https://twitter.com/missingwatcher) right now on Twitter and participate in the fully interactive story to help make decisions that will determine the ultimate outcome of our hero's journey! There's also an animated series of Frontier in the works based on The Watcher's universe! Best of all, every single collector will feature in the lore! How awesome is that?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/E6EGrtI.png)\n\n> I get such strong [Dead Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Space_(video_game)) vibes from this and I love it!\n\nSo where do I even start with a project as awesome and ambitious as Frontier? Well, let's talk a little about The Watchers themselves who are the heroes of Frontier. Each of them comes with $DATA Utility Tokens, in-game Hero Skins, in-game Sector Skins and Priority in-game Queues. They are available in both digital and physical editions, and soon players will be able to interact with them in Augmented Reality (AR). Check out some of the (now sold out) Watchers below:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JiFlNRD.jpg)\n\n> This Aqua Watcher looks like he's ready to go scuba diving...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hsQRGlS.jpg)\n\n> The Savage Watcher likes hanging around in public bathrooms at night\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8QnBv0P.jpg)\n\n> Minimalism is the key to this Black Watcher's signature style\n\nDon't worry, more Watchers will be available for purchase soon. Until then, head over to [Rarible](https://rarible.com/missingwatcher?tab=created) to see what you can pick up there...that is, if any owners are willing to part with their Watchers!\n\n## The Mechanics of Frontier\n\nOK, so I'm gonna do my best to explain a couple of the mechanics and items that players will be able to purchase and use within the Frontier universe. Here goes:\n\n**The Black Box** - This is a limited edition, non-playable utility NFT. Every player that holds a Black Box on a given date will receive The Data Key. In addition, those players that hold The Black Box *and* a Watcher NFT on a certain date will receive the 'Stellar Edition' of The Data Key. Players will be able to open their Black Box and mint two random Flash Blocks of any rarity tier. Conversely, players may choose to keep their Black Box which will lead to something completely different occurring. Until such time, players are advised to 'keep safe and stay tuned' as everything will be revealed in due course.\n\n‍![](https://i.imgur.com/wxCvFz4.png)\n\n> Take note that Black Box Series One is **sold out**. If you want to grab one, head over to [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/frontiergame) and purchase one for about 1.6 ETH (this is subject to change of course)\n\n**Flash Blocks** - These consist of weapons, shields, traps and hacks. In essence, these are abilities players can employ on the battlefield. Regardless of whether players are attacking or defending a sector, they will have the opportunity to use three Flash Blocks, each of which has a different effect that can dramatically alter the final outcome of a battle. Take note that all Flash Blocks have a short cooldown once they have been used. There are three different types of Flash Blocks:\n\n- *Attack* - These Flash Blocks can be deployed to devastate your enemies or, at the very least, severely impede them\n- *Defense* - Under heavy fire? Defense Flash Blocks help you withstand even the most punishing attacks from your opponents\n- *Glitch* - These are the ultimate weapons for players to exploit. They are far more powerful than standard Flash Blocks and therefore have a much longer cooldown time. They also happen to be the only blocks players can directly collect that have a guaranteed rarity. As such, Glitch Blocks are only available for purchase in The Glitch page for a limited 24 hour period\n\n**The Data Keys** - These are non-playable utility NFTs that guarantee premium advantages. Data Keys give players special access to drops and NFTs as well as the alpha version of Frontier. In addition, Data Keys grant players the right to cast votes and even create proposals. Finally, Data Keys allow players to redeem $DATA, Frontier's Utility Token. Data Keys are issued to all players that retain ownership of a Frontier NFT. Moreover, dedicated supporters receive a 'Stellar Edition' of The Data Key, granting them access to special airdrops and exclusive in-game items.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tMBA1q2.jpg)\n\n> Access card or key? How about a Data Key?\n\n## So What's Next for Frontier?\n\nThere's a lot going on in the Frontier camp, but a close look at their website reveals that Leaderboards, Flash Blocks, Glitch Blocks, 'The Synthesis,' Heroes and even Avatars are all currently in development. If you want to learn more about what the team has planned, I implore you to check out their [Roadmap](https://www.missingfrontier.com/frontier-roadmap).\n\nYou can also find out more about the game and its mechanics on Frontier's [About page](https://www.missingfrontier.com/about).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jtXc0LG.png)\n\n> Season One of Frontier begins soon! You don't want to miss this!\n\n## Allow Me to Crunch the Numbers\n\nFrontier's a pretty unique project—it's a Blockchain-based game, it's Augmented Reality, it's got NFTs and an already impressive community...need I go on? Check out some of Frontier's stats below:\n\n* **100% Custom** - ‍Everything is minted and generated under Frontier's custom smart contracts\n* **The Black Box Series One** - These are officially *sold out*, and Frontier will *never* sell them again\n* **3,000 Available Keys** - $DATA Utility Tokens (ERC-20) will be distributed to all Frontier NFT holders\n\nAgain, pretty much everything on Frontier is currently sold out, but you can view items on their [Rarible](https://rarible.com/missingwatcher?tab=created) and/or [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/frontiergame) pages.\n\nAnd in terms of their 'traditional' stats, well, Frontier currently boasts the following on their OpenSea:\n\n- **Items** - 2\n- **Owners** - 2.1K\n- **Floor Price** - 0.27 ETH\n- **Volume Traded** - 4K\n\nI think I could go on about Frontier all day, so I'll leave you with this instead—with so much going on, and so much time, effort and care being put into this incredibly stylish and energetic Blockchain-based project, can you really afford to miss out on such a golden opportunity? Make the right choice and follow Frontier on all their social media pages without hesitation!

Whether it's their art, vibrant communities, or the unique features planned for their projects, there is definitely something here that'll be to your liking! Today we bring you Metaverse Travel Agency!***\n\n## Traversing the Boundless Metaverse\n\nIt's Monday! You know what that means, right? A brand new week full of Discoveries of the Day here at MSQ, and man do we have some awesome projects to show you this week. As the Metaverse evolves, it's only a matter of time before we end up like everybody in the movie [Ready Player One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One_(film)). I don't know about you, but when I'm in the Metaverse, I want to be the pinnacle of *swag.* Well...[Metaverse Travel Agency](https://themta.io/) may be the key to unlocking maximum drip 🔑\n\nMetaverse Travel Agency (or MTA) brings something fresh to the NFT space. So what if you could actually *wear* your NFT in the Metaverse? MTA is pioneering the next generation of wearable NFTs on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. Their first collection consists of 10,101 randomly assembled Metahelmets, each of which is entirely unique. However, some are rarer than others. They are shaped from over 100 possible traits with each helmet including **The Quantum Machine**. As an added bonus, each Metahelmet is equipped with a screen that allows users to display other NFTs they own directly on the helmet.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cqs9nKK.gif)\n\n> Walking around with a $100k Ape on your helmet? Living life on the edge...I like it!\n\nAlongside **The Quantum Machine** owning a helmet includes special membership benefits, such as NFT gated access to the Metaverse headquarters and quests, 3D files (glb), ownership and commercial usage rights for the NFT and much more coming in the roadmap. Metaverse Travel Agency is also partnered with [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) and [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/) meaning the helmets will be specially optimized to be worn in each Metaverse.\n\n## What's in Store for Metanauts?\n\nOnce you purchase a Metahelmet, there are five roles you can assume as a Metanaut:\n\n1. **Architect** - These highly sought after Metanauts are capable of building impossible structures with their tools. \n2. **Hacker** - Extremely difficult to find, these Metanauts deploy software and solve critical technical problems as part of their primary function.\n3. **Guardian** - These are the protectors of all members of the Metaverse. They uphold the rules and ensure MTA members are treated with respect and courtesy.\n4. **Explorer** - These Metanauts have visited every corner of the known Metaverse and constantly seek to expand its boundaries. They are responsible for uncovering new quests and solving intricate puzzles.\n5. **Academicians** - The first point of contact for initiates in the virtual world, Academicians help and guide users on everything there is to know about the Metaverse including its assets and people.\n\nThe Metaverse Travel Agency has a bright future with an action-packed Roadmap which includes items like a Community Wallet, Community Adventures, Development of the MTA Headquarters, Exclusive Merchandise, Exclusive Events, Giveaways and so much more. \n\nCheck out the full Roadmap below 👇\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/s7siqjQ.png)\n\n## Sounds Rad! Where Can I Get One?\n\nYou can get your hands on these remarkable Metahelmets on October 7th. Join MTA's [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/h3JKVavUSA) for more information on the release.

Whether it's their unique artwork, energetic communities or the amazing features planned for their projects, there's no doubt that something here will tickle your fancy. Today we bring you Woodies!***\n\n## The Magical Forest Dwellers of Wondermist\n\nNature—as modern humans, many of us have lost our intrinsic connection with the natural world. The advent of modern medicine coupled with an ever increasing level of global interconnectedness (among other factors) has, in many respects, separated us from Nature. We are nowhere near as fragile as we used to be, and no single other predator or creature is able to oppose our intellect and capacity to innovate. But the truth is that we are indeed part of the very Nature we have sought to dominate and arbitrarily exploit to suit our every want and need. Our world is fragile, and thus, we are as well.\n\nPerhaps this is what makes today's Discovery of the Day particularly special—an awareness and understanding that, in order to make the world better, we need to give more to one another and replace what we have taken from Nature.\n\n### The Story of Arden and the Evil Logger\n\nLong ago, when the world was a purer, freer place, a tribe of magical trees lived, laughing and playing together in peace and harmony. But then, one terrible night, the trees were cut down and hauled away by a nefarious antagonist known only as 'The Logger.' By some providence, a solitary tree by the name of Arden was left untouched. Without hesitation, he knew exactly what needed to be done—Arden steeled his resolve and decided to uncover the location of the evil Logger and rescue his friends from his grimy clutches! Now our hero finds himself on an epic journey fraught with peril, but one he must nevertheless undertake if he ever hopes to recover his lost kin and restore the forest to its former glory.\n\nWoodies is a collection of 10,000 avatars created by [UltraDAO](https://ultradao.org/). However, Woodies isn't simply another avatar project—driven by one of the biggest 10k project teams along with an established artist DAO, Woodies' underlying story and characters have both substance and ultimately serve a higher purpose. Future content will be be highly developed with an emphasis on offering meaningful rewards to collectors. Woodies exist as ERC-721 token on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain while all data is hosted on [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) (IPFS).\n\nEvery single Woodie is entirely unique and randomly generated at the time of mint from more than 900 possible traits including eyes, hats, clothing, masks and so on. In the near future, a separate collection of hand-drawn Core Characters from the Woodies universe, including the lead protagonist Arden, will be available for purchase and trading. These special characters will be provided at random to anyone holding a Woodies Mint Passport. So now with all of the integral stuff covered, let's check out some of these colorful woodland characters:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nM4wk7V.png)\n\n> I wonder what Pokémon Gym this Woodie belongs to?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dh4dltn.png)\n\n> A bird on the head is worth two in the bush...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SU9zBwn.png)\n\n> Wilhelmina's hairstylist is well-paid for a reason\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Woodies is more than just an NFT project. The team has entered into a partnership with [Trees for the Future](https://trees.org/) and committed to planting 1 million trees in sub-Saharan Africa. The latest update indicates that Woodies has donated 73.824 ETH thus far, allowing for more than 837,000 trees to be planted. It looks like they're already close to their goal and may well surpass it—it's refreshing to see an NFT project looking to change the world for the better. You can find out more about this monumental passport [here](https://trees.org/post/woodiesnft/).\n\n## Blazing a Trail to Prosperity\n\nWoodies actually has an extensive Roadmap (or 'Trail Guide') spanning several months and three distinct phases. For the sake of brevity, we'll briefly summarize Woodies' current trajectory:\n\n**Phase 1 - 10K Woodies** - This phase should take place over the course of Fall/Winter 2021. Events and items listed under this initial stage include The Nameless Woodies (Challenges), Woodies Goodies (Merch), Woodies Comic (Airdrop), One Million Trees Campaign (Giving Back), and Woodies Lore (Exclusive Artwork).\n\n**Phase 2 - Woodies World** - Due to take place over the course of early 2022, this phase includes Woodies 3D (Metaverse), Woodies World (also Metaverse), and Woodies Comic (Airdop).\n\n**Phase 3 - Woodies Membership** - Taking place from mid-to-late 2022, this phase encompasses Woodies Weekends (Members Only), Woodies Kids Club (also Members Only), and Additional Content (Extras).\n\nThe full 'Trail Guide' can be viewed on Woodies' [official site](https://woodiesnft.com/).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5ltW4h7.png)\n\n> Arden, the main protagonist in the Woodies universe\n\n## Statistics\n\nWoodies is still a relatively new project but has gained a lot of traction in the past few months. Moreover, its growing following and active team bode well for the future. You can grab yourself a *Woodie* right now via [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/woodies-generative). See below for stats:\n\n* **Total Items** - 4.8k\n* **Owners** - 2K\n* **Floor Price** - 0.25 ETH\n* **Volume Traded** - 1K ETH\n\nMint passports are currently sold out, but you can purchase one on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/woodies-mint-passport). Stats for *Mint Passports* are as follows:\n\n* **Total Items** - 3\n* **Owners** - 2K\n* **Floor Price** - 0.44 ETH\n* **Volume Traded** - 2.5K ETH\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pdtn0t8.png)\n\nWoodies is dedicated to sustainability, environmental awareness and building a better world.

Whether it's their art, dedicated communities, or the unique features planned for their projects, there is definitely something here that will catch your eye. Today we bring you Fang Gang!**_\n\n## Man It Feels Good to Be a Fangsta\n\n[Fang Gang](https://fanggang.io/) is a collection of 8,888 NFTs on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) Blockchain. They are programmatically generated from over 160 traits with 3,676,470 possible combinations and primed to take over the metaverse.\n\nThis howlingly hardcore collection goes well beyond just looking dope AF (As Fang) though. From collaborations to daily giveaways, charitable donations, NFTx liquidity pools, a merch store, and more, Fang Gang is, by far, one of _the_ most active and impressive projects we've come across. We can't possibly cover it all in one article, but read on to see just _some_ of what this incredible community and project have to offer...\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Z6C1MDd/fang-gang.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n### Rarity\n\nEach Fang Gang NFT possesses a unique personality with each combination of traits being either Common, Uncommon, Rare, or Mythic. Some are rarer than others, but all fit for members of the Fang Gang. In addition, some Fangsters are special 1/1 editions, meaning nobody’s ever gonna bite their toes.\n\n<div style=\"width: 90%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![You’ll hear them howl in the streets at night about who’s got the most sauce.](https://i.ibb.co/ctvzhJw/fang-gang-rarity.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\n### Diamond Fangs Club\n\nEvery day, Fang Gang holders who have their holdings either delisted or listed above 1 ETH are eligible to win prizes!\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/6s0ydyH/diamond-fangs.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\n**Diamond Fangs DLC Drop**:\n\nJust this week, Diamond Fang Club members were airdropped a free [@decentraland](https://twitter.com/decentraland)-compatible outfit created by NFT artist and designer [@Michi_Todd](https://twitter.com/michi_todd).\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/BcFqCL1/diamond-fangs-dlc-drop.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 400px; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n<b>uwu</b>\n\n</div>\n\n### NFTx Liquidity Pool\n\nThe [Fang Gang NFTx.io](https://nftx.io/vault/0xebd9dc65c723cadc0ee4ee5a8013ddd3db98f250/info/) liquidity pool recently launched, allowing holders to buy, sell, or stake their Fangsters. Neat!\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/8rX9dbF/fang-gang-lp.png)\n\n</div>\n\n### Collaboration\n\nIf the Fang Gang team knows anything, it's how to collaborate with some of the sickest artists in the NFT space. Below is just a taste of what’s been created so far 💪\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/JF9s2j7/fang-gang-cfw-collab.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n**[cfw™](https://twitter.com/iamcfw) x Fang Gang**\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/cJhHR9V/fang-gang-unstablekiddo-collab.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n**[Unstable Kido](https://twitter.com/unstablekido) x Fang Gang**\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/SdSZyFq/fang-gang-bkk-bros-collab.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n**[BKK Bros.](https://twitter.com/bkk_bros) x Fang Gang**\n\n</div>\n\n### Giving Back\n\nWhile the Fangsters live a good life in the urban jungle, not all creatures on planet Earth share this happy lifestyle. That’s why the Fang Gang team wants to give back part of their profits to NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) that protect and restore wildlife habitats and ecosystems. These charities are fairly chosen by community vote from a pool of candidate organizations.\n\nMost recently, 10 ETH was donated to [SeaShepherd.org](https://seashepherd.org) as well as another NGO to be selected and announced soon. These donations are made through [The Giving Block](https://thegivingblock.com/), the #1 crypto donations platform, providing verified transactions.\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/LNSZyfF/Three-Two-Pix-Teaser.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n## What's Next for Fang Gang?\n\n* **0%** - Giveaways and launch\n* **25%** - Collab Fangsters by NFT artists—auctions and exclusive drops to holders\n* **50%** - First charity donation chosen by the community\n* **75%** - ETH and NFT giveaways to holders\n* **100%** - Premium Merch Store and second charity donation chosen by the community\n\n<div style=\"width: 90%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![Fang Gang Roadmap 2.0](https://i.ibb.co/frtCzJ7/Roadmap2-0.png)\n\n</div>\n\n> A lot of our plans are long-term, so they will happen repeatedly and along the way, while we build the community and grow together. Collaboration is one of the wildest perks. Happening through exclusive airdrops for holders or special pieces auctioned within the collection, these will make Fang Gang connect with big names in the NFT community.\n>\n> Bite first, talk later. That’s our way.\n\n### PixelFangs\n\nScheduled for release in the second week of October, a new collection containing 8,888 PixelFangs will soon be made available. Each Fang Gang NFT holder will be able to mint 1 per wallet for free (plus gas, of course).\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/v1fNPxC/pixel-fangs.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\n### FangRunner\n\nAn endless runner game; evade flippers and dodge paper hands while running through New Fang City collecting diamonds. Try to get a high score...there just might be something cool in store for those that rule the leaderboards 😉\n\n<div style=\"width: 80%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/N9Yz4w6/Three-Two-Pix-Game-Set.png)\n\n</div>\n\n### New Fang City\n\nNew Fang City is coming to life in the form of a new hub.

[Solsnatchers](https://solsnatchers.com/) is a frightening collection of 10,000 randomly generated Grim Reapers that dwell deep within the Underworld of the [Solana](https://solana.com/) Blockchain.

The Solsnatchers are created from a combination of 220 unique attributes, meaning there are over 4 million possible iterations.\n\nEach SolSnatcher serves as a key to open the digital portal to the SolUnderworld. This portal only opens once a day, and at seemingly random times. However, if a Snatcher is lucky enough to successfully open the portal, they will discover valuable mystery rewards and a token as proof of their triumphant snatch.

      "body": "***Join us as we take a look at our Discovery of the Day! Whether it's their impressive artwork, bustling communities or the incredible features planned for their projects, there's definitely something here just for you! Today we bring you Cryowar!***\n\n## Start a War\n\n> The realm of Solariance's history is one tainted by bloodshed and brutal conflict. With their existence teetering on the precipice, the Solarians sacrificed all they had to preserve their world and earn the favor of their Gods. Mercifully, the Armistice of Akava seemingly brought the aeons-long war to an end. The four Gods, *Sullr*, *Senemeer*, *Lavaden* and *Vigolar*, embittered and weary from fighting, ascended to their skyrealms, finally granting the people of Solariance a measure of peace.\n> \n> 10,000 years have passed, and with the Armistice long forgotten and the great oracles of Nastra and Akava mysteriously 'missing,' *Sullr* and *Vigolar* have emerged from their dreadful sleep to avenge the apparent deaths of their most worthy servants. As the enraged duo reigned terror upon Faragoan's Kingdom, *Senemeer* and *Lavaden* returned from the Astral Plane to quell their aggression. The old Armistice is indeed null and void, and growing rumblings within the Astral Plane herald the rise of new Gods eager to join in glorious battle. Welcome...to the Cryowar!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XpjW7Cq.png)\n\nIf the lore isn't enough to get you pumped up for this Discovery of the Day, then I'd wager nothing can move you. [Cryowar](https://cryowar.com/) is a next-gen Blockchain-based multiplayer game built on top of the [Solana](https://solana.com/) Ecosystem. Harnessing the power of the [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) 4 and available across several different platforms, Cryowar boasts exhilarating gameplay, crisp visuals and a rewards system that favors skill over bank balance. Yes, you read right—absolutely nothing in the Cryowar in-game store will give players any kind of competitive advantage over their opponents. In other words, everyone fights on an even playing field, and only skill will determine who moves up the ranks.\n\n### Game Mechanics\n\nAnother integral part of Cryowar's mechanics is its short match times. Battles typically last no longer than 3 minutes at a time, allowing players to participate in quick games whenever they want from virtually anywhere. Players will also find that they will need to rapidly adapt their strategies and playing styles—since Cryowar randomly cycles through a pool of level objectives at the start of every match and changes them on the fly, players can never get too comfortable or resort to gimmicks in order to succeed in battle. In short, whatever the game throws at you, be ready for it.\n\nAccording to the Cryowar site, four different game modes will form the basis of Cryowar:\n\n- **Last Man Standing** - Survive all the way to the end and vanquish your foes\n- **Deathmatch** - An all-out slugfest where everyone is your enemy\n- **Top Score in 5 Minutes** - Gain as many points as possible in 5 minutes\n- **Battle Arena** - Player versus Player where the best warrior takes the crown\n\n### Meet the Heroes of Solariance\n\nCryowar has three different classes of heroes, each with their own combat style, skills and backstory. Let's take a brief look at each now:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/v72meiR.png)\n\n> **The ACS Heavy** is a veritable walking fortress with unprecedented might and resolve, who combines ancient tactics with the unmatched fury of the Gods\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sxozHpg.png)\n\n> **The Valkyrie** is named after the mythical Norse maidens who carried the souls of worthy fallen warriors to Valhalla. Their precise and lightning-quick movements allow them to make short work of their adversaries, slashing them to ribbons in mere seconds\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EFOiNp7.png)\n\n> **The Centurion** is a Holy Warrior skilled with both sword and pistol. He righteously wields the Gods' technology, cleansing all heretics in a hailstorm of sanctimonious gunfire\n\n## The Heart and Soul of Cryowar\n\nCryowar is an ambitious project that aims high. Herewith a summary of some of its key features and most noteworthy aspects:\n\n- **Multiplayer NFT** - Cryowar is a real-time multiplayer PvP arena NFT game utilizing the Unreal Engine on the Solana Network\n- **Amalgam** - Cryowar combines the best parts of traditional gaming with the innovative features of Blockchain technology including DAO voting, NFTs and Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n- **Deflationary** - The game's ecosystem will make use of a deflationary mechanism that integrates staking with gameplay, giving RPG stakers the ability to earn better rewards by increasing their in-game skill and experience levels\n- **Multi-Blockchain Medieval Metaverse** - The ultimate goal of Cryowar is to create a Multi-Blockchain Medieval Metaverse without boundaries\n- **Game Mechanics** - Cryowar is a cross-platform multiplayer game that will eventually feature up to 8 unique character and focus on skill-based gameplay in order to reward players accordingly\n\n## What Battles Await Cryowar?\n\nSince the beginning of 2021, the team behind Cryowar has already achieved several milestones, though the Private sale from Q3 is still seemingly ongoing and the Public Sale is yet to be announced. Despite these apparent delays, Cryowar's team is still hard at work to bring the game to players sooner rather than later. The Official Release is slated for release in Q4 of 2021, so hopefully we'll all get the chance to check out some gameplay in the very near future.\n\n> Take a look at the full Roadmap available in the Cryowar [Whitepaper](https://cryowar.com/files/wp.pdf) below\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bivwSkV.png)\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **How can I join the Private sale?**\n>\n> The Private sale round is almost over and only applicable to long-term partners that can provide important strategic value to the success of the project. No presale has been announced as yet\n\n> **How can I participate in Beta testing?**\n>\n> Beta testing registration has been closed as a result of the huge number of applications that have been received. Having said this, players are urged to stick around as the team is pretty creative and may come up with several possible ways to include a wider segment of the Cryowar community\n\n> **When and how is the Public sale/IDO/ICO going to happen?**\n>\n> The IDO will be offered on several different platforms with the first being [Solanium](https://www.solanium.io/). All relevant information regarding whitelisting may be found on the official Solanium website. Further additions will be announced in due course.\n\n> **When is Official Beta testing expected to take place?**\n>\n> It is expected to occur in **Q4 of 2021** *(Note that this is subject to change without warning)*\n\n> **When will I be able to play Cryowar?**\n>\n> Cryowar is currently in its pre-launch phase. The team are fully committed to pleasing all relevant stakeholders and delivering a polished final product as soon as humanly possible\n\n## The Judgment of the Gods\n\nCryowar have certainly spent a huge amount of time developing their offering and have built up a substantial following on their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cryowar), [Telegram](https://t.me/cryowar) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CryowarDevs) pages. Good things take time, and while the team has made huge progress, there are obviously several integral components that need to be fine-tuned before anything is officially released. Be sure to follow Cryowar on their social media pages and get ready for some more amazing content very soon!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4AwM5kP.png)\n\n> For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) on SubStack, and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar) on Twitter.\n\n*We will be hosting giveaways for eligible members on the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) every Friday at 3PM ET.

Whether it's their killer artwork, enthusiastic communities or the awesome features planned for their projects, there's definitely something here you'll be sure to love! Today we bring you Party DJ Space Club!***\n\n## Partying Across the Galaxy!\n\nAh who doesn't love a wild dance party? Picture it—the thumping bass, the energy of the crowd, flashing strobe lights and grooving the whole night away to your favorite songs...sounds like a good time to me! We here at MSQ are all about those unforgettable nights of partying and cutting loose. For this reason, today's Discovery of the Day is sure to get the likes of [Daft Punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daft_Punk) turning their shiny helmeted heads and nodding in perfect rhythmic approval.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sUIsruM.gif)\n\n> See? What did I tell you?\n\n[Party DJ Space Club](https://partydjspaceclub.com/) (or PDSC) is a collection of 2,000 limited edition Party Space DJs all bopping and shimmying across the dance floors of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. By purchasing one of these rare and totally happening NFTs, owners will instantly gain access to an exclusive club that offers some insanely cool benefits as well as a healthy dose of fun and income opportunities.\n\nMinting a Party DJ means that owners will be part of the most elite VIP Virtual Nightclub to ever grace the digital world! And that's not all—holders will also enjoy some special (and totally secret) rare drops as well as early access to any and all future collections. We strongly advise you to keep a lookout for the PDSC Spaceship as it gathers more awesome party animals from Earth and travels back and forth, transporting them to some of the greatest Nightclubs in the known Universe!\n\nEach one of the 2,000 Party DJs is entirely unique and derived from various traits including facial expressions, helmets, visors, spacesuits, badges and, of course, beautifully generated color backgrounds. While some might be rarer than others, the project has a revolutionary protocol to generate a crop of new (and even rarer) Party DJs using their Space Pod.\n\nSo what exactly do these Supercharged Sonic Samurais look like? Well, here's just a small sample of the freshly futuristic aficionados for your eyes to savor!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/o7X2rev.png)\n\nThis bangin' Party DJ actually belongs to our very own [Justin Renken](https://MSQ.io/users/justin)! It's his first art NFT!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MCX49nW.png)\n\nSpace Knight decided to go a little harder on the bling for today's performance...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RHyEWMA.png)\n\n[Saitama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-Punch_Man) wants everyone to know his favorite genre without having to say it\n\n## Arranging the Beats of the Future\n\nParty DJ Space Club already has an extensive [Roadmap](https://partydjspaceclub.com/#roadmap) divided into five distinct phases. It covers everything from the actual NFT launch (which sold out in 10 minutes, by the way), merchandise, upgrading to Super Party DJs via the Space Pod, an official PDSC weekend EDM Event in Las Vegas, and the launch of the Moon Club virtual game! Check out all you get from becoming an owner 👇\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QmuafPR.png)\n\n> Again, the full Roadmap is available in its original form on the Party DJ Space Club [official website](https://partydjspaceclub.com/#roadmap)\n\n## Stats\n\nSadly all the Party DJs sold out real quickly, but fear not—you can head over to PDSC's [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/partydjspaceclub) and get yours right now! Some fundamental stats for your perusal.\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\n\n- **Total Items** - 2,000\n- **Total Owners** - 463\n\nRemember that, unlike other generative projects that feature 10,000 items, Party DJ Space Club only features 2,000. It's little wonder that they sold out so quickly!

      "slug": "tokenizing-sports-how-cryptocurrency-could-revolutionize-professional-and-collegiate-athletics",
      "body": "***Things have changed in the world of Sports in the past few months. With the Coronavirus preventing people from gathering in large crowds and interest in cryptoassets and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the rise, there's strong evidence that crypto could truly alter the way professional and collegiate athletics works now and for the foreseeable future...***\n\nIn the last year alone, the sports world has witnessed an immense rebalancing of financial opportunity. High school basketball players are opting to sign professional contracts overseas instead of playing in college. College athletes are cashing in on endorsements now that the [NCAA](https://www.ncaa.org/) has changed its name, image and likeness (NIL) rules. Sports betting is legal in over 20 states and counting. With the floodgates of opportunity opening with the ease of regulations, here’s how cryptocurrency could have a lasting impact on the future of professional and collegiate athletics.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Jx26Iqu.png)\n\n> Well over 100 years old, the NCAA's latest move has changed the game for athletes\n\n## Social tokens\n\nSince the change to the NCAA’s NIL rules in July, we’ve seen two college athletes partner with Rally to launch their own social tokens. In the broader cryptocurrency sector, it's easy to see social tokens as a sort of gimmick, more functional as a way for celebrities to monetize their status than an actual investment or store of value.\n\nBut it’s very possible that in the world of sports, social tokens will become a trend that captivates fans of all levels. If you’ve ever watched a nationally ranked prospect at one of their High School games, you’ve probably had this thought:\n\n> 'Wow, if I could invest in a player’s future, that’s the person I’d pick!'\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tDFU6oI.gif)\n\nA similar thought creeps into my mind anytime I watch the draft for a major sports league, constantly trying to pick out the diamonds in the rough and stake my claim on their future stardom for bragging rights down the line. But what if there was a way to financially invest in these players for the payoff of money instead of bragging rights? What if players signed deals that connected their social tokens to contracts, paying out owners a fraction of the massive deals signed once they made it big?\n\nWhile the premise may seem far-fetched, it could revolutionize the way fans connect to their favorite athletes by creating monetary relationships between them.\n\n## Crypto Gambling\n\nWith the sports gambling industry barreling into the mainstream with each passing month, it’s only a matter of time until crypto gambling reaches similar levels of popularity. As it currently stands, gambling on sports with cryptocurrency is only legal in one state—Wyoming.\n\nWhile it could take years for some of the more populous states to adopt crypto gambling, when they do, it will create an entirely new billion dollar industry. I think that it’s unlikely we see the current titans of the gambling space, names like [DraftKings](https://www.draftkings.com/), for example, build out successful crypto wings to capture the new market.\n\nIt’s most likely that new companies take hold of the space, possibly in partnership with some of the major exchanges. Since we’re talking about a development that might not take place for a matter of years, no one can even predict what the crypto space will look like at that time. But if you’re like me, and believe that the adoption of Blockchain will only increase with each year the technology does, it’s very likely that, within the next decade, we’ll be living in a world where sports betters prefer to wager in their cryptocurrency of choice instead of the US dollar.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8T9rGvn.jpg)\n\n> Crypto may one day play an integral role in the world of gambling and sports betting\n\n## NFTs\n\nWhen we talk about the future of NFTs in the realm of sports, most will bring up the obvious comparison between the trading card market and the potential for an equally popular digital one. Already, companies like [NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/) have been madly successful in monetizing the collectability aspect of sports moments and scaling their models to different fan bases.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/88KNw21.png)\n\n> NBA Top Shot are playing for keeps in the NFT Industry\n\nWhile the digital sports card model will undoubtedly thrive, Blockchain technology is likely to have an important effect on sports in other ways. I envision a future where every ticket purchased to every sporting event is expressed as an NFT, and owners can look back on decades of games they attended with permanent keepsakes.\n\nFor so long, sports fans have been living through an era of live events that lack originality—people are tired of getting commemorative t-shirts at games with an email receipt of their ticket—they’d much rather have NFTs, or fan tokens, or access to future digital metaverse experiences with the purchase of their tickets, and it’s only a matter of time before franchises recognize this and begin integrating cryptocurrency into every aspect of the fan experience.\n\nAs valuable as the World Series home run ball will continue to be, the NFT of the seat's ticket will also be a worthwhile keepsake. But unlike a physical ball, the value of the ticket on a secondary market will not be riddled with doubts of authenticity...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/740gxP3.gif)",

Whether it's their original artwork, great communities or the unique features planned for their projects, there's sure to be something here for you! Today we bring you Dark Horizon!***\n\n## Neo-Noir NFTs\n\nVisions of a [Dystopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia) future have been around for years, and they're arguably more prevalent today than ever before. When you consider all the issues we face as a species, it's often difficult to arrive at anything but a dour appraisal of the situation. Having said this, there's something enthralling about a future in which humanity has expanded to every corner of the globe and technology has far surpassed our expectations. Flying cars, sprawling cityscapes complete with towering skyscrapers and an ever present thick, smoky haze hanging in the air all make for a visually rich experience, if nothing else.\n\nArguably no film exemplifies this aesthetic better than [Blade Runner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner), the 1982 Cult Classic by Sci-Fi auteur [Ridley Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott) based on [Philip K. Dick's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick) 1968 novel, *[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F)* Similarly, [Denis Villeneuve's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Villeneuve) 2017 follow-up, [Blade Runner 2049](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner_2049), while more diverse in terms of its choice of color filters, is an intense visual and emotional experience for fans of the Neo-noir genre.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cqXYlg3.gif)\n\n> Mega corporations and ubiquitous media presence are both imposing and impressive\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dEmhReV.gif)\n\nNeon blues and pinks evoke a sense of nostalgia in *Blade Runner 2049*\n\n[Dark Horizon](https://www.darkhorizon.io/) is what you might consider an NFT homage to Blade Runner and films like it. Check out the narrative behind the project and you'll see exactly what I mean:\n\n> **INCOMING MESSAGE - MS7193**\n>\n> JOIN THE GLORIOUS RESISTANCE TODAY, AND TOGETHER WE WILL ANNIHILATE THE ELITES.\n>\n> FOR TOO LONG, THEY HAVE EXPLOITED THE COMMON MAN, USING TECHNOLOGY TO CONTROL US - FOR AMUSEMENT, FOR PROFIT. BUT NO MORE. TOGETHER WE ARE STRONGER.\n>\n> HUNTERS MAY HAVE INFILTRATED OUR LEGION OF 8,686 UNIQUE, HAND-DRAWN FIGHTERS, BUT OUR GAME IS ALREADY IN DEVELOPMENT AND WE WILL BE VICTORIOUS.\n>\n> LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION. DEATH TO ELITES.\n>\n> **END OF MESSAGE**\n\nClass warfare, bounty hunters, exploitation, revolution? I think that about covers it. To summarize, Dark Horizon consists of 8,686 hand-drawn generative warriors fighting tirelessly to dismantle the power structures ruthlessly defended by the Elites on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) Blockchain. It seems not all is well within the ranks of the Resistance since Hunters have been sent by those in power to bring an end to all dissidence.\n\nEach Dark Horizon Warrior is created from a number of different traits including different heads, hairstyles, accessories, weapons, background and foreground colors, eyes, outfits and so on. This is all as a result of Dark Horizon's unique selection algorithm that you can learn more about via this informative [Medium article](https://medium.com/@DarkHorizon/welcome-to-the-dark-horizon-cd2b257a1651) the team put out recently. When you own a Dark Horizon NFT, you can rest assured that it is entirely unique and that it is yours and yours alone.\n\nNow without any further delays, let's take a look at some examples of these NFTs.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nMdnOuj.jpg)\n\n> Love the colors here, and that mask is just too awesome!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0frOvPj.png)\n\n> I've got a feeling this droid may be a Hunter...look out!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/o2lTQFr.jpg)\n\n> I wouldn't mess with this lady, she looks like she means business!\n\n## What Does the Future Hold for Dark Horizon?\n\nDark Horizon sold out in under 20 minutes, so it's safe to say their sale was a complete success. In terms of the project's Roadmap, well, you won't find it on their website. If you want to view the Dark Horizon's Roadmap, you'll need to join their official [Discord](https://discord.gg/darkhorizonnft) and check it out there.

Today we bring you CrypToadz!***\n\n## Hopping Through the Metaverse\n\n[CrypToadz](https://cryptoadz.io/) is a collection of 6,969 pixelated amphibious creatures trying to escape the tyrannical rule of the Evil King Gremplin. The project is in the public domain, which means the Toadz can be used in any way a holder wants. The artist behind this fun NFT collection goes by the name of [Gremplin](https://twitter.com/supergremplin), and you can view some of his other work right [here](https://tryshowtime.com/GREMPLIN?list=created).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TlhaERX.png)\n\n> The magnificent Gremplin in all his, uh...glory?\n\nNow believe it or not, some time after the birth of the Metaverse, a mysterious toxic sludge appeared. So this sludge infected humans, aliens, apes, and cats, causing them to slowly shrink in size and develop rough, leathery skin (isn't that just splendid?) So naturally, all of the infected eventually became...Toadz. Hey, if I knew I was gonna look that cool as a Toad, I would've touched the toxic sludge willingly!\n\nThe CrypToadz live in a place they call the Uniswamp, which is a swampy basin of the Metaverse situated near the waters of Cryptovoxels. Unfortunately all CrypToadz were disturbed by the Evil King Gremplin who exiled the leader of the CrypToadz to Gooch Land. This resulted in King Gremplin taking over and renaming Uniswamp 'GREMPLAND.' That really is quite the heartrending story, if I do say so myself.\n\nThe time has come! Let's take a look at some of these terrific Toadz!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WWBr0g6.png)\n\n> Goodness, gracious, great balls of Bullfrogs!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dnK9Uv7.png)\n\n> Hey!

The project runs purely on the great community and adorable pixel-art Toadz that underpin it. And personally? We love that...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eHd67jF.png)\n\nHowever, one thing the team is working on is their [CV](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/) (Cryptovoxel) plot, which is where they will host gatherings as well as a shrine of Toadz. Oh man, can you imagine the total vibing vibes that'll be felt there? I'll bet it's...toad-ally transcendent!\n\n## Croakin' Stats\n\nThe CrypToadz collection is currently sold out, but you can still grab yourself one of these little hopping critters over on the project's [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptoadz-by-gremplin) page.\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information:*\n\n* **Total Items** - 6,969\n* **Owners** - 3.2K\n\nCrypToadz is a seriously unique NFT project that you'll definitely want to keep following.

      "body": "***Join us as we take a look at our Discovery of the Day! Whether it's their phenomenal artwork, awesome communities, or the exciting features planned for their projects, there's undoubtedly something here for you! Today we bring you OpenBlox!***\n\n## Excitement, Adventure, and Collaboration in OpenBlox\n\n2021 has been an absolutely sterling year for crypto and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). With each passing day, more and more individuals and organizations are waking up to the massive potential of NFTs to fundamentally change the way in which both players and developers create sustainable digital economies. By decentralizing elements using Blockchain technology, community involvement is becoming an evermore important part of the new financial system.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yTYDbls.gif)\n\n> 'Oh these shades? Got 'em on OpenSea'\n\n[OpenBlox](https://openblox.io/) is an exciting new Play-to-Earn game in which users can venture forth with their unique characters known as Blox to discover a magical world that is continuously growing and developing. However, OpenBlox takes the experience a step further for players—it is also a one-stop platform that serves as an incubator for NFT gaming with interesting Intellectual Property (IP). To this end, OpenBlox aims to produce a series of games covering different modes including trading card games (TCGs), action role-playing games (ARPGs), FTG, role-playing games (RPGs), simulation video games (SIMs) and so forth.\n\nWhat is a Blox, you ask? Well, it's a collectible NFT ERC-721 token. In the OpenBlox world, a Blox is created as the fundamental character for not just one, but a series of games. Each Blox is programmatically generated and provably unique. No two Blox will ever be the same. The OpenBlox world resides within the colorful realms of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain. Note that the OpenBlox team are looking in to Layer-2 solutions in order to reduce gas fees and improve the overall experience for players.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6H850Of.png)\n\n> Each Blox is made of 6 elements, namely head, body, arms, legs, horns, and back. The body and head are determined by the Blox’s class, while its combat skills depend on the arms, legs, horns and back\n\nThe Blox world consists of three layers:\n\n- **The Water Layer** - with the Fish and the Frog\n- **The Fire Layer** - with the Techno and the Dragon\n- **The Green Layer** - with the Insect and the Flower\n\nAt one point these worlds existed separately, but after an unknown force effectively broke the boundaries between them, an 'upward spiral' was created. This totally transformed the Blox world into something truly diverse and complex in nature. As such, this newfound balance has changed the characteristics of the creatures that dwell within this uniquely diverse ecosystem.\n\n## How to Play OpenBlox\n\nThere are two options for players within the OpenBlox universe, namely Player-versus-Environment (PvE) or Player-versus-Player (PvP). In PvE, teams consisting of three Blox each travel across the OpenBlox to find and collect hidden treasures. However, this journey is fraught with peril...monsters and other challenges will force players to be on their guard and carefully consider their strategies in order to avoid defeat. Over time, these monsters and challenges will become more treacherous and difficult to overcome. Successfully completing challenges and vanquishing enemies will increase a team's experience and allow them to earn tokens in the process. Once the deepest part of the randomly generated scenario map is reached, players will be able to take on the boss of the area.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/y4NZeHn.png)\n\nIn PvP Battle mode, players queue in the Ranked Arena in order to be randomly paired with an opponent of similar skill. The Blox Combat System is a turn-based card game that is won by the player that successfully eliminates their opponent's team. Winners receive rewards while qualified players will earn game tokens as well as special equipment.\n\nUsers will need to adhere to an energy system. Each player will start off with an energy level of 20 bars, with 1 bar expended per round of gameplay. Every 24 hours, a player's energy levels will be fully replenished.\n\n## Genesis Blox: 'Hold & Grow to Earn'\n\nThe first collection OpenBlox will be releasing is Genesis Blox with a total of 7,998 available for minting. Any Blox users mint will serve not just as a profile picture for their social media pages, but as a central character for a series of games within the OpenBlox Ecosystem (yes, many games, not just one). In the future, users will be able to breed and trade their Blox on an open marketplace.\n\nThe team plans to launch the game's Closed Beta by the end of November 2021, and Genesis holders will have priority access to it. The official public game is set to launch about one month later in December. Check out the OpenBlox [website](https://openblox.io/) to find out more about this and get any and all of the latest updates.\n\nGENESIS Blox holders will always (and exclusively) earn a stable revenue from OpenBlox's proprietary breeding system. Their offspring and family growth will help them earn a dividend of up to 20% of the breeding fee, a substantial amount indeed.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/204qgsa.jpg)\n\nFor the breeding fee, a total of 16% will go directly into the Genesis Mint Holder Vault. This amount will subsequently be divided up and shared equally by all 7,998 Genesis holders.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/q8tl4lD.png)\n\nGenesis holders are encouraged to breed and build their own families as this will increase their chances of sharing the remaining 4% of the total breeding fee.\n\n## What Does Father Time Plan for the Blox?\n\nOpenBlox has a promising Roadmap with many drops planned as well as the implementation of the Blox Breeding System. Oh, and of course, there's the launch of the game itself. How could I forget? Anyway, you can peruse the Q4 2021 Roadmap below 👇\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8sQrh2q.png)\n\n## Info on Minting\n\nMinting for Genesis Blox commences on October 16th 2021. You can grab yourself one of these totally awesome and unique Blox via the project's [Presale](https://openblox.io/presale) page on their website. Watch that countdown closely! This one may just sell out in record time!\n\nHerewith the details of the Mint so you know exactly what to expect:\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\n\n* **Total Items** - 7,998\n* **Mint Price** - 0.3 ETH\n\nOpenBlox is set to be one of the top projects in the realms of Blockchain Gaming and NFTs. There's quite a bit to this Blockchain Endeavor, so make sure you follow OpenBlox on their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/openblox_io) and join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/openblox) to find out more about the project's continued development and expanding community.

Whether it's their super artwork, passionate communities, or the great features planned for their projects, there's sure to be something here you'll love! Today we bring you Galactic Apes!***\n\n## A Guide to the Galactic Apes\n\nPrep your crews, assemble your ships and reclaim the universe for the glory of the apes! [Galactic Apes](https://galacticapes.com/) is a collection of 9,999 strong simians who live in the Metaverse. Galactic Apes isn't your everyday PFP project—it includes gamification and allows you to run missions with your crew. Missions form the basis of the gamification mechanism within the Galactic Apes universe. With your crew(s), you will be able to complete missions that yield other NFTs and rewards. Let's dive deeper into this amazing project!\n\n### Missions\n\nTo participate in missions, you'll need a crew of strong Apes with fighting spirit! You can even have multiple crews that run different missions simultaneously. Depending on your crew mix, you could have significant advantages over other competing crews.\n\nThe best combination (crew mix) to have in descending order is:\n\n- 3 Galactic Apes total with 1 of each Genus\n- 3 Galactic Apes total with any mix\n- 2 Galactic Apes total with any mix\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YWcvUUc.png)\n\n> Chimpanzee\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SYfvRRx.png)\n\n> Gorilla\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DUFhhQy.png)\n\n> Orangutan\n\n### Apes for Hire\n\nNot only will you be able to run missions with your own crew, but you will be able to hire out or borrow an ape, apes or full crew(s) services with an owner-set fee/bounty as payment. Hired apes will allow users to complete or improve a partial crew and/or hire a full crew to run a mission (whether they are ape owners themselves or not!)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HTxDC7x.jpg)\n\nThe tweet below details the approximate cost of running or participating in missions:\n\n![](twitter:GalacticApesNFT/status/1445183241166770176?s=20)\n\n### Galactic Monkey Support Crew\n\nLastly, the team recently announced [Monkeys](https://twitter.com/GalacticApesNFT/status/1444353380911095810). These helpful primates can be added to full crews to complete missions more efficiently.\n\n- There are 7 different monkey genera\n- Monkeys can be hired out for a fee (paid to the monkey NFT owner)\n- For each ape you hold, you will be able to claim one monkey\n\nThe Monkeys will be free to mint—all you have to pay is gas. As an added bonus, they will feature brand new traits! To find out more about hiring monkeys, check out the tweet below:\n\n![](twitter:GalacticApesNFT/status/1444688434124238852)\n\nWowee! That was a lot of info to process! Talk about NFTs having utility, am I right?\n\n## Galactic Apes...Starmap?\n\nThe team have assured the community that this is just the beginning and they don't plan to rush through the process, calling it a 'marathon, not a sprint.' The team are clearly working their socks off, and I'm definitely impressed with what I've seen so far!\n\nThe Roadmap is divided into three distinct phases:\n\n### Phase 1: Activate the Galactic Shipyard\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZmJQYB0.gif)\n\n### Phase 2: Activate Missions\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2yOTBay.gif)\n\n### Phase 3: Enter the Metaverse\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9lE9f7.gif)\n\nFrom the information and screenshots I've seen so far, I'm confident with where this project is going, and quite frankly, this is the most excited I've been to see where a project is headed for quite some time—the devs have done an awesome job so far! Visit the Galactic Apes [website](https://galacticapes.com/) to view the latest Roadmap and stay up-to-date with the latest developments.\n\n## Stats\n\nThe Galactic Apes collection is currently sold out, but you can still grab yourself one of these charming apes over on the project's [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/galacticapes) page.\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information:*\n\n* **Total Items** - 9,999\n* **Owners** - 3.5K\n\nGalactic Apes is a seriously unique NFT project that you'll definitely want to follow closely.

Every so often we encounter a project that is so impressive we simply have to give it the kudos and attention it so rightly deserves. Sneaky Vampire Syndicate is one such project that has done an amazing job at growing its community, offering rewards to its holders and bringing transparency and credibility to the world of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Blockchain as a whole. Join us as we celebrate their achievements and tell you exactly why they are our October 2021 Collectible of the Month!***\n\n## It's the Counts That Bought\n\nA metric ton of books, movies and other forms of media explore the concept of vampirism using a variety of approaches, and each has served to define the way we see these bloodthirsty beasts over the past few decades. In the world of NFTs, [Sneaky Vampire Syndicate](https://svs.gg/), a collection of 8,888 Vampires living in the lairs of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain, has made a massive impact, so much so that their cultural significance is already transcending the niche domain of Blockchain and attaining a measure of visibility within the world as a whole. One need only visit their official [Discord](https://discord.gg/WED7vYtT) (which boasts well over 36,000 members) and peruse their announcements channel to see that this is no exaggeration. See for yourself:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PAypAcm.jpg)\n\n> Sneaky Vampires on the streets of Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eIRKfd6.jpg)\n\n> Look around Times Square in New York and you'll be sure to see SVS!\n\nSuch awesome advertising costs a pretty penny, but if you're concerned about the project really giving back to society...fear not—these Vamps really care, and to demonstrate their commitment to making the world a better place, the team behind SVS has pledged 1,000 blankets to [Blankets of Hope](https://www.blanketsofhope.com/our-story), a Global Non-Profit Organization that provides blankets to the homeless and needy. Sneaky Vampire Syndicate's NFTs may be scary, but the community behind these rare stylish avatars has a heart of gold.\n\n> We recently released a Discovery of the Day about Sneaky Vampire Syndicate—you can view the full post [here](https://MSQ.io/blog/sneaky-vampire-syndicate-nft-vampires-on-the-scene)\n\n## Devilishly Debonair\n\nA large part of the project's success is undoubtedly in the design of the vampires themselves. If you know about the [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/) (BAYC), then you're already familiar with the artist behind Sneaky Vampire Syndicate, [migwashere](https://twitter.com/notthetechguy). While there are some clear differences between BAYC and SVS, migwashere's distinct touch is present in both projects, and both have enjoyed a substantial amount of success and praise over the past few weeks. Let's take a look at a sample of the 1st Generation of Vampires you can purchase over on SVS' [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/sneaky-vampire-syndicate) page:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xyKXZxQ.png)\n\n> Somewhere between Twilight, Blade and Dracula, there's this guy...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1zzqjkL.png)\n\n> Vampires have been spotted across the ages and in the Orient as well\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/378Bdk2.png)\n\n> Working for the Military has this cool Vamp hot under the collar\n\n### 'What's $BLOOD If Not For Sharing?'\n\nAnother great feature for Vampire holders is the ability to stake their Vampires in exchange for $BLOOD tokens. As a utility token, $BLOOD has no monetary value attached to it. $BLOOD will essentially serve as the fuel for everything SVS related, and over time, the utility of this token will be enhanced. In order for Vampire holders to stake their Vampires, they must follow these steps:\n\n- Holders must first visit https://dash.svs.gg/\n- They will then need to connect their web3 wallet - everything SVS related will now be hosted on the Dashboard under a single login\n- Holders may stake their Vampires to receive daily $BLOOD. The longer a holder stakes, the more blood they will earn\n- Vampires receive 3 $BLOOD for every day they are staked. When Bats are released, they will earn 1 $BLOOD for every day they are staked\n- As an added bonus, there are no lock-ins, minimum time requirements or ties. Holders can stake and unstake their Vampires at any time\n\n> At time of writing, gas is high. As such, holders are urged to kindly wait for it to drop before staking their Vampires\n\n## The Road Beyond Transylvania\n\nSneaky Vampire Syndicate continues its way forward with Roadmap 2 which can be viewed directly on their [website](https://svs.gg/). Gen 2 of SVS, as well as Gen 2 companions, are high on the list of priorities. For your convenience, we've provided the SVS Roadmap 2 so you can check it out right here.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yJ0zSWp.png)\n\n## Salutations Unto The Syndicate\n\nMSQ is working towards the establishment of a more unified, collaborative and wider crypto community. Within the realms of decentralization, it's the people behind great projects and protocols that make all the difference. Sneaky Vampire Syndicate is surging forward with their goals and already giving back to their community and the world. Their distinct style, relentless pursuit of excellence, highly motivated team and rapidly growing community are all testament to their achievements and the fundamental strength of the project. It's for these many great reasons that Sneaky Vampire Syndicate is our Collectible of the Month! To all you fashionable undead bloodsuckers within the SVS community, we salute you and have no doubt that the Vamps will spread across the length and breadth of the mortal world very soon...",

      "name": "Apricot Finance is our Project of the Month! October 2021",
      "slug": "apricot-finance-is-our-project-of-the-month-october-2021",
      "body": "**MSQ is the new homepage for the decentralized web, and as such, we have plenty of great projects that have already joined us. From Blockchain games and DeFi protocols to NFTs and entire ecosystems, MSQ has it all. Every month we highlight some of the best performing projects and show them some much-deserved love and attention. Apricot Finance is a next-gen DeFi platform built on the Solana Blockchain. Having only been around for a few months, Apricot has already gained massive traction and is very close to its mainnet launch. For this reason, we have selected them for our October 2021 Project of the Month!**\n\n## DeFi Done Differently and Definitively\n\nA few weeks ago we released a DeFi Spotlight [article](https://MSQ.io/blog/defi-spotlight-apricot-finance) on Apricot Finance explaining its unique mechanics and why it provides lenders and borrowers with a significant edge when yield farming on leverage. In principle, Apricot's offering consists of three interrelated parts, namely *Apricot Lend*, *Apricot Cross-Farm (X-Farm)* and *Apricot Assist*. Without getting into the real nitty gritty, we'll briefly summarize the functions of these three components:\n\n- **Apricot Lend** - Since Apricot is cross-margin, users can deposit any cryptoassets, including LP tokens, and gain borrowing power in the process\n- **Apricot X-Farm** - A 'logical extension' for a lending protocol, X-Farm allows users to start leveraged yield farming without ever having to actually own any of the underlying tokens. Users can deposit non-stablecoin cryptoassets as collateral and borrow *both* with up to 3x leverage\n- **Apricot Assist** - An 'automated self-deleveraging assistant’ and arguably the finest part of Apricot's arsenal, Apricot Assist allows users to decide under what conditions, which assets and what portion of said assets should be sold or redeemed in order to prevent positions being liquidated\n\nIf you would like to find out more regarding the above, be sure to check out our [DeFi Spotlight](https://MSQ.io/blog/defi-spotlight-apricot-finance) on Apricot. The above summary is something of an oversimplification, but it covers the fundamental aspects of the protocol. Apricot themselves have also been kind enough to provide their own summary from their most recent [Medium article](https://apricotfinance.medium.com/updates-on-mainnet-launch-8f76855cc652) covering their upcoming mainnet launch:\n\n> Apricot Finance is a next-generation lending protocol on [Solana](https://solana.com/), offering cross-margin leveraged yield farming and an automated self-deleveraging mechanism that enables users to maximize returns while maintaining downside protection. In the future, Apricot plans to tap into the concept of securitization in traditional finance to explore sustainable solutions for bad debt processing.\n\nWhile the underlying mechanics behind Apricot are suitably complex, virtually all of the grunt work is handled by the protocol itself. The result is a highly intuitive and easy-to-use DeFi platform that allows users a greater amount of freedom while significantly bolstering their personal financial security. By eliminating barriers to entry and introducing novel technologies to the the lending and borrowing mix, Apricot Finance has effectively reimagined DeFi and opened it up to a much wider audience in the process.\n\n## Imminent Mainnet Launch\n\nThe inertia within and behind the Apricot Finance team is nothing short of immense. Having secured $4 million in funding as recently as August 25th 2021, Apricot has blazed the proverbial trail and is already on the precipice of its mainnet launch having enjoyed a successful testnet release on September 10th. In fact, the mainnet launch is billed to occur on October 19th at 10 AM EST. The amount of time and effort that has been plowed into reaching this enormous milestone is undeniably massive, and we have every confidence that the team has worked tirelessly to ensure that the final product is everything users hope for and then some.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hSMyDTj.jpg)\n\n### New Features\n\nYou can be sure that the Apricot team hasn't stopped their development work and are constantly reviewing feedback and considering the value of their overall offering. The following briefly outlines the main updates to the protocol since we first covered Apricot in our Spotlight article:\n\n- **Assist History Archive** - As you might have guessed, this relates directly to Apricot Assist, which will automatically trigger and deleverage a user's account when their *Borrow Limit Used* exceeds the *Trigger Level* as defined by the user themselves. As long as Assist is enabled, users are largely protected against the possibility of liquidation. Since the world of crypto never skips a beat, Assist may trigger when a user is asleep or busy with some other activity. For this reason, Apricot's team has introduced a record that details all Assist trigger actions so that users may review said actions and determine exactly what occurred at a given point in time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jKk6SXX.png)\n\n> An example of how a triggered event is recorded within Apricot's platform\n\nIn addition to the above, in order to make Apricot Assist function more efficiently within the mainnet environment, each time Assist is triggered, exactly *one *action is carried out rather than a string of actions. In most instances, this single action is sufficient to bring a user's account below Assist's Trigger Level. However, if this is not the case, Assist will simply trigger numerous times, and with each new triggered event, a record will be logged in the Archive for a users to review at their leisure.\n\n- **Light Color Mode** - A number of testnet users requested the addition of a light color mode for Apricot's platform. For this reason, the team has delivered a theme intended to instill a sense of tranquility and comfort in end users. To this end, Apricot's light mode should help its users to enjoy a largely stress-free yield farming experience.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dp1ZzTc.png)\n\n> Apricot's new light mode will definitely brighten up your day\n\n### New Partners\n\nApricot, much like MSQ, is all about partnerships and collaboration. Apricot is dedicated to the development of Solana's growing DeFi ecosystem and is working in tandem with its partners to achieve all-new milestones. These new partners include:\n\n- **Wallets** - Once Apricot's mainnet launches, support for Phantom, Sollet, Coin98, Solflare, Slope and Math will be added\n- **New Asset Pools** - Apricot already has a a pipeline of collateral assets and farming pools they are actively working to bring online as soon as possible. Users can visit their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/C6JrtqZF5U) or [Telegram](https://t.me/ApricotOfficial) and tell the team exactly what elements they would like to see supported first\n\n## Here's to Apricot Finance! \n\nWith such an active team and engaged community, not to mention a replete protocol with all the bells and whistles, Apricot Finance is more than deserving of MSQ's Project of the Month for October 2021. Having personally engaged with the core team on a number of occasions and followed their swift progress closely over the past few months, we can confidently say that Apricot Finance is entirely legitimate and set to make a major impact within the world of Decentralized Finance. Congratulations, and here's the a bright, decentralized future!",

      "slug": "lost-relics-is-our-game-of-the-month-october-2021",
      "body": "***At MSQ we are constantly on the lookout for new additions to grow our community of dApps, services, and projects. Sometimes we stumble across something with so much potential, we simply have to shine a light on it. This month we take a look at a Free-to-Play, Play-to-Earn, Role-Playing Game (RPG), that uses Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and combines it with the fun replayability of a Dungeon Crawler that could give most AAA Action-Adventure Role-Playing Games (ARPGs) a run for their money. Let's see why Lost Relics is so special and what makes it our October 2021 Game of the Month!***\n\n## Dungeons, Loot, and NFTs\n\n[Lost Relics](https://lostrelics.io/) is a Blockchain-based ARPG created in May 2019 by Australian game studio *Codebit Labs*. Crazy as it sounds, this game was built entirely by one individual, Cliff Crawley. A developer with an impressive list of prior work in the gaming industry, Cliff has since turned his attention to the rapidly evolving world of Blockchain. Inspired by Classic Dungeon Crawlers like [Diablo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_(video_game)) and MMORPGs like [Runescape](https://play.runescape.com/), and with Cliff free to do as he pleased, *Lost Relics* was born.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vl1VclJ.jpg)\n\n> We recently held a Lost Relics NFT item giveaway on [MSQ Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjqDD3L3HjOTFRdc9H_-Pig) that turned out to be a big hit. Check out the full stream [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbawlTlOcJ0)\n\nUsing the [Enjin](https://enjin.io/) Blockchain and powered by [Unity](https://unity.com/), Cliff engineered a system that beautifully pairs in-game NFT items with Play-to-Earn aspects to create an engaging and immersive world while maintaining the central Free-to-Play element. With digital ownership at its core, *Lost Relics* is among one of the most enjoyable Play-to-Earn experiences we have seen so far. And unlike other Play-to-Earn games, the random loot drop system of *Lost Relics* provides an equal opportunity for all players to earn NFTs from day one.\n\nRecently, *Enjin*, which is a Layer-2 solution for the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain, added the [JumpNet](https://enjin.io/products/jumpnet). Like most NFT-based games currently built on *Ethereum*, there are major issues with the fluctuating gas fees that come with purchasing, selling, and trading NFTs. *JumpNet* aims to attenuate this longstanding issue, and *Lost Relics* has already benefited from the effects of this system.\n\n*JumpNet* is an [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) (EVM), acting as a sister network that allows its users to transfer their *Enjin* coins (ENJ) to *JumpNet Enjin* tokens (JENJ). This offers all the same NFT transfer systems as Ethereum, but the key difference here is that there are no gas fees. *Lost Relics* uses two internal currency systems, one of which is now directly tied to JENJ, allowing players even more freedom to sell their in-game NFTs. Users who are unfamiliar with NFT markets like [Enjinx](https://enjinx.io/eth/marketplace) or [Opensea](https://opensea.io/) can technically buy and sell items for real world money entirely in-game. Users do have to use their wallets to convert back to real world money, but thankfully, this is very easy to do.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gpcdodi.png)\n\n> JumpNet has literally changed the game for Blockchain gaming enthusiasts\n\n## The World of Lost Relics\n\n*Lost Relics* is a fantasy world centered on the small town of Talmuth. Like most ARPGs, *Lost Relics* uses a top-down approach to gameplay. However, a new feature that allows players to choose between this view and a closer camera angle was recently introduced. The look and feel of *Lost Relics* is similar to previous offerings, but this has the effect of instilling a sense of comfort and familiarity within gamers. The art style really shines in the twilight hours when the sun goes down and the night begins. As the lanterns around town light up, an almost entirely new world of color and volume arises thanks to the dynamic lighting system within the game's core architecture.\n\nNew players are given a choice between either 2 or 4 different skins depending on their membership status, but all are changeable at any time. Players can also earn or purchase custom skins from events, sellers, or the *multiverse collection*. New players can equip both a ranged and melee weapon, leaving it up to users to decide if they want to focus on close quarters or ranged combat, but always being able to employ both whenever they wish. As players increase their XP, new options, abilities, and perks are unlocked. A recent patch shifted the focus towards increasing in-game skill levels. These are required to collect valuable resources for crafting items that can be sold or used in-game.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jTeFORs.jpg)\n\n> The weapons and items within Lost Relics feature some truly amazing designs\n\nWhile there are plenty of things to do in the town of Talmuth, the dungeons are where the heart of *Lost Relics* truly lies. Easily discovered using the in-game map option, players explore and fight their way through randomly generated dungeons to gain XP, upgrade their skills and, most importantly, attempt to get their hands on some NFT drops. Dungeon types are easily identified thanks to the recognizable visual representations of each tier. Players can easily determine what enemies they will encounter as well as what kind of skills can be upgraded.\n\nAn 'Adventure Token' was originally required to gain access to the dungeons, but this component is now a thing of the past. Any player, whether active or not, can now enjoy the endless adventure that Play-to-Earn brings. However, active members gain exclusive access to certain skills and XP increases—even entire dungeon tiers can be unlocked if players put in the required time and effort.\n\nPerhaps the most crucial factor that makes *Lost Relics* so special, besides the game itself, is the community that has formed (and continuing to grow) around it. Even a brief visit to the *Lost Relics* Discord reveals just how vibrant, engaged and active the community is—the lingering feeling is that you are very much part of a wider family separated only by geographical distance. New players are free to ask for help and assistance, and veterans willingly offer advice and actively discuss the game with newbies on a regular basis. While the game itself is already very impressive, the community is truly remarkable in its own right and accommodates both old and new players alike.\n\n## A Toast to Lost Relics!\n\nMSQ has checked out several Blockchain games so far, and many of them have a huge amount of potential and already offer players an opportunity to have fun, make friends and earn crypto for their efforts. This said, *Lost Relics* is definitely a top contender in the space with a healthy community that is growing by the day. As a Blockchain game, its mechanics are already well developed, and in the future we expect even bigger things from the team and community of dedicated gamers and crypto enthusiasts. It's for these reasons that *Lost Relics* is our Game of the Month for October 2021! From all of us at MSQ, we congratulate everyone behind and within the project and eagerly look forward to what the future holds!",

      "body": "***Join us as we bring you another epic Discovery of the Day! There's an entire universe of projects to check out in the wider cryptoverse, and we're doing our best to bring you some of the most promising ones around! If it has a great community, amazing developers and some awesome features, then we want to know about it! Without further ado, today we present: Solana Bananas!***\n\n## A Banana Republic?\n\nDictators, despots, authoritarians, tyrants...call 'em whatever you want, but there have been a bunch of 'em over the years. Those that presided over economies that depended almost exclusively on the exportation of agricultural goods, particularly coffee or bananas, were the undisputed leaders of what became known as *Banana Republics.* Yes, trouble in paradise, [Far Cry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Cry_(video_game)) 1 without the trigens, tropical travesties—you get the idea.\n\nWhat does this have to do with our Discovery of the Day? Everything and nothing of course. [Solana Bananas](https://solanabananas.com/) is an NFT collection of 1,500 flavorsome fruits hanging in the plantations of the [Solana](https://solana.com/) Blockchain. Each of these entirely unique bananas is algorithmically generated and stored with proof of ownership on Solana's fast, efficient and secure Blockchain. As an added bonus, when a user mints a Solana Banana, they will have the chance to mint an ultra rare Banana like the treasured *Golden Banana*, or a *Zombie Banana*.\n\nEvery Banana is made up from over 130 different attributes including background color, facial expression, hairstyle, eyewear, skin color, apparel, clothing and so on. Certain attributes are rarer than others, but regardless of what a user receives, there will only ever be 1,500 Solana Bananas.\n\nSolana Bananas wants to give back to the world, which is exactly why 10% of all proceeds will go directly towards the [Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund](https://gorillafund.org/). As an organization that protects critically endangered mountain gorillas through research, training, community outreach, and constant on-the-ground presence in Rwanda, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund needs sufficient support to ensure their work is carried out unimpeded. Solana Bananas believe this cause to be very much aligned with their values and the theme behind their lively NFT project.\n\nAnd now let's take a look at some of these brilliant Bananas up-close:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ob8Nd3x.png)\n\n> Snake Banana Skin is here to chew gum and retain his ripeness...and he's all outta ripeness\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XhnHpuq.png)\n\n> Hours in the Miami sun left Bert Banana feeling uncharacteristically red\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jTv6C4D.png)\n\n> Bullish Blue Banana brazenly binges barbital brands\n\n## Ba Na Na Naaaaa...Ba Na Na Naaaaa (It's Beethoven)\n\nForgive the onomatopoeia, it's nearly impossible for me to write such a Potassium-rich post like this without making a pun or two. So the Solana Bananas Roadmap (which you can also view in their [Discord](https://discord.gg/hMQPFTZ2)) is detailed below for your convenience. Q3 of 2021 has come and gone, but it seems like there's a fair amount planned for the coming months and all the way into the second quarter of 2022. Very nice stuff. Anyway, see for yourself:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kK9nHPP.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sDl3AAV.png)\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that, unlike many other projects that feature several thousand generative NFTs, Solana Bananas is limited to a mere 1,500. This means fewer owners, greater rarity and, if all goes according to plan, higher value as the months and years roll by. From what I can tell, the project is moving along at a healthy pace and has a suitably strong community behind it.\n\n## Stats\n\nSolana Bananas is currently sold out, so if you want to pick one up, you'll need to head over to their [Solanart page](https://solanart.io/collections/solanabananas) and buy one there. Now how about some stats?\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\n\n- **Total Items** - 264/1,500\n- **Total Owners** - 196\n\nWell, what can I tell you? Solana Bananas is a delightfully quirky NFT project with some fun features and a unique approach within the ever-expanding world of Non-Fungible Tokens. Be sure to check out their [website](https://solanabananas.com/), follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SolanaBananas) and join their [Discord](https://discord.gg/hMQPFTZ2) for all the latest news from the bunch (I can't help myself, OK?) That's it for now NFT fans! Until we meet again, stay safe and stay awesome!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZboJXj8.png)\n\n> For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) on SubStack, and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar) on Twitter.\n\n*We will be hosting giveaways for eligible members on the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) every Friday at 3PM ET.

Variable traits include eyes, noses, mouths, heads, and bodies, all with no explicitly gendered characteristics so that everyone is equally represented without any discrimination.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XR1laIU.png)\n\n> *Our efforts focus on innovating within the NFT space & empowering our holders in creative ways*\n\n### Rarity\n\nIf you love your Deadfella, you already got a good one. Each Deadfella has been meticulously crafted with quality artwork and ensured compatibility for social media profile picture use in mind. Whatever you choose, and however you decide to use it, your Deadfella is going to look on-point.\n\nIf it’s rarity you’re after though, the Deadfellaz collection is designed for rarity to be easily determined from a quick glance. The level of degradation within Deadfellaz is the marker—simply put, the more degraded a Deadfella is, the rarer it is. There are three clear categories of degradation, namely *fresh*, *damaged*, and *rotten*.\n\n### Community\n\nThe Deadfellaz team keeps their promises about staying faithful to their community too. Just take a look at some of their latest contests and events on offer right now—and this is just a small taste. Visit the [Deadfellaz Twitter](https://twitter.com/Deadfellaznft) account or join them on [Discord](https://discord.gg/eAuFcxmKGS) to find out more!\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/gtPKs7P/pumpkinfellaz.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n[#pumpkinfellaz](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pumpkinfellaz)\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2100/1*Vd5l0KAQKDiiY9Vt9_40YQ.png)\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n[Deadfellaz: Infected | Metaverse Halloween Event](https://deadfellaz.medium.com/deadfellaz-infected-metaverse-halloween-event-880b1dedba49)\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ZEHcNJKbV1EP13K1S_eXhQ.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n[Songs of the Dead: Deadfellaz Song Contest](https://deadfellaz.medium.com/songs-of-the-dead-deadfellaz-song-contest-9591e260ac4e)\n\n</div>\n\n## Roadmap of the Dead\n\nDon't worry, [George A. Romero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_A._Romero) would be proud of that one, I just know it. A project as ambitious and energized as Deadfellaz isn't without a suitably busy schedule. The project has already hit a few notable milestones and isn't showing any signs of stopping. Don't take my word for it though...check it out:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hd1P7DT.jpg)\n\n## Heartstopping Stats\n\nAll 10,000 Deadfellaz NFTs have already been minted, but you can still pick some up on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/deadfellaz).\n\nAlready snagged some of these ghoulishly glorious NFTs or just want to scope all of the sickest traits?

      "body": "At MSQ, we believe that the blockchain industry needs to put a much larger focus on community building and breaking down barriers. In order to do that, we have made our focus as wide as possible and welcome all forms of projects and users from all over the cryptoverse to join and be a part of the MSQ community. We welcome them with open arms and do our best to provide value back to them through features, interviews, and in the case of games, even live streams at [MSQ Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjqDD3L3HjOTFRdc9H_-Pig).\n\nThis model has proven to be a winning combination and the MSQ community continues to grow every day, but we want to do more. We think that too many communities in the cryptoverse are focused strictly on price and how soon they can get on their rocket to the moon. In order for the industry to grow and mature, we need to focus on looking past generic price talk and move into a phase where we use the technology to push new ideas and build new blockchain-based systems that show the true power of the decentralized tools we are all building.\n\nWith that said, we are happy to introduce our first new original product by the MSQ team. \n\n## Welcome to NFTY Village\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/W6Sj7lY.png)\n\nNFTY Village is an original product being built by MSQ. In NFTY Village, we will create an awesome new NFT collection, a new and innovative community loyalty program, and a fully featured game to bring it all together. We believe NFTY Village can set the standard for blockchain-based community building and loyalty programs moving forward and we can't wait to show you more.\n\nLet's take a look at what it all means in a bit more detail.\n\n## NFTY Village is an NFT Collection\n\nIn case it wasn't already clear, NFTY Village is squarely focused on providing added utility and rewards to users through the power of NFTs. Collectibles are one of the largest categories of projects listed on MSQ for a reason and we can't wait to unveil our first collection—but we won't stop there. NFTY Village will feature a series of NFT collections that will form a NFTY Village Metaverse over time. We will post an entire blog article outlining more about our NFT collection as well, but as a sneak peek, we will be starting with *Season 1: Journey to Alpacria*.\n\n## NFTY Village is a Loyalty Program\n\nWith NFTY Village, we are introducing a brand new community experience through a series of something we call 'Journeys.' Journeys will encourage community engagement and interaction through a series of challenges that will reward custom NFTs in the NFTY Village Metaverse. We will release an entire blog post outlining the NFTY Village Loyalty Program and what you can expect, but for now, think of it as a cross between a loyalty program, a Fortnite Battle Pass, and an NFT drop.\n\n## NFTY Village is a Game, Powered by NFTs\n\nNFTs are great, but NFTs with utility are even better. That is why all of the NFTs released as part of the NFTY Village metaverse, whether it be through the loyalty program, special promotions, mint passes, or in-game, will be fully redeemable in the NFTY Village game. That means any Villagers, Pets, or In-Game Decor you receive for participating in the NFTY Village Loyalty Program, Mints, or Airdrops will all be usable in-game to decorate your own village. This brings a new level of value and utility to our loyalty program, and we think it's going to be a lot of fun!\n\n## Yes, I Want That! Sign Me Up!\n\nNFTY Village is an exciting new project and we would love to have you on board! We will be announcing an upcoming mint pass release, our full roadmap, as well as more details on our systems in the upcoming weeks. To get the most up-to-date information and be the first to know, [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/a5taGuD3) and follow [NFTY Village on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NftyVillage)!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8T8Ch78.png)",

Whatever it is, you can be sure we've done our research and bring you only the most reputable and noteworthy projects within the cryptosphere. Today we're proud to present...Lamb Duhs!***\n\n## Into the Duhverse\n\n[Lamb Duhs](https://www.lambduhs.com/) is a collection of 8,500 cute little digital lambs wandering across the pastures of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain. Each Lamb Duh is randomly generated from over 350,000 possible combinations with a variety of different traits including facial features, wool colors and outfit accessories.\n\nWhen you become a verified holder of a Lamb Duh, you unlock some special perks such as being able to attend exclusive events, compete in art contests and access special channels in the Duhverse Discord. Nice!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GAiAA56.jpg)\n\nLamb Duhs features 6 different rarity levels which are calculated based on accessory points. Each head and body accessory is worth between 1 and 4 points depending on how unique they are. The points are then added up to give a total value between 2 and 8 points. The more points, the rarer the Lamb Duh. Take a closer look at the different rarity levels below:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2vYQFnt.jpg)\n\n> These sweet little lambs were created by the exceptionally talented [Roxilla](https://twitter.com/roxillaaaa)\n\nNow let's take a peek at some of the members of this inimitable muttony mob: \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mFXCNpK.png)\n\n> Neil Lambstrong really missed his Russian friend Yuri Lambgarin\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/i3HwF2K.png)\n\n> Trying to hold in a sneeze on the high seas was tough for Captain Lamb Marrow\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/prs7AGx.png)\n\n> Lamby Krueger was annoyed he'd forgotten his signature [Dennis the Menace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_the_Menace_and_Gnasher) pullover\n\n## Mary Had a Little Roadmap\n\nThe Duhverse has a bunch planned with their Roadmap outlining several events including a special raffle, live stream, treasure hunt and an 'open source/mystery announcement!' 👀\n\nSome other plans on the horizon include a charity auction, original airdrops, community wallet and merchandise store. So in short, there's plenty going on in the Duhverse for you to get involved in!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EODDmRh.png)\n\n> It's so great that there's a Lamb Duh version of [Bob Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross) in this Roadmap\n\nThe team has fulfilled most of the above Roadmap and is in the process of drafting a far more ambitious Roadmap 2.0, so be sure to check their website regularly for updates!\n\n## Sheepy Stats\n\nThe Lamb Duhs collection is currently sold out, but you can still grab yourself one (or more) of these charming Lambs over on the project's [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/lambduhs) page. Check out some stats below!\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\n\n* **Total Items** - 8.5K\n* **Owners** - 2.6K\n\nLamb Duhs is an adorable NFT project that you'll definitely want to watch.

      "slug": "project-eluune-play-to-earn-with-floating-stargarden-nfts",
      "body": "***That's right! It's time for another amazing Discovery of the Day! MSQ is the home of everything Blockchain, DeFi and NFT-related. For your convenience, we bring you some of our favorite projects in the cryptosphere every single day, Monday to Friday! Today we proudly present: Project Eluüne!***\n\n## A Sublime Walk Through Celestial Gardens\n\nThe universe is impossibly vast, spanning some 93 billion lightyears—and that's just what we can see. According to leading physicists, it's still expanding, and one day, millions of years from now, our night sky may be completely devoid of stars.\n\nWith this poignant thought in mind, it would be truly amazing to own and hold a star of our very own—in this way, despite the relentless march of time, we could keep our bright and shining friends within arms reach instead of having them move further and further away from us with every passing second.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/adWoEYY.gif)\n\n[Project Eluüne](https://www.arrivant.com/) takes this notion several steps further by offering NFT enthusiasts a floating island that will be their main point of entry into the Metaverse. As such, these *Founder's StarGardens* will serve a very specific purpose in Project Eluüne's upcoming Play-to-Earn (P2E) game. A total of 7,027 Founder's StarGardens, secured on the [Solana](https://solana.com/) Blockchain, will become available for minting on October 27th, 2021.\n\nBy minting a Founder's StarGarden, users become the owners of playspaces as well as the leaders of the Tribes that populate them. A player's StarGarden levels up along with its members, permanently improving Play-to-Earn opportunities for anyone on it. When a user owns a StarGarden, they alone decide who is permitted to join their Tribe. Lastly, every StarGarden is an NFT, meaning that it is entirely unique and may be used to a player's advantage in the upcoming game.\n\nSimply put, StarGardens are not static, lifeless things, but rather living entities that evolve over time. This means that progression content accumulates on a StarGarden and becomes permanent. Thus, the more a StarGarden is used, the more powerful it becomes, thereby unlocking new gameplay options and enhancing its overall value and utility if traded. This mechanic is unique in that, the more an NFT is used, the more valuable it becomes, whereas in most projects, the opposite is true.\n\nProject Eluüne's upcoming Play-to-Earn game is an MMORPG that is being expertly crafted by experienced designers of successful metagames such as [Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/) and [World of Warships](https://worldofwarships.eu/). In other words, the engineers behind the game are seasoned professionals with years of knowledge in the gaming industry. Even a cursory look at some of the concept art suggests that Project Eluüne is set to be an incredible experience for anyone lucky enough to get hold of a StarGarden (and anybody else since the game will be free-to-play).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gqvl2WF.jpg)\n\n> I think [Ridley Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott) and [H.R. Geiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._R._Giger) would approve of this character design\n\nEach Founder's StarGarden possesses unique traits within its metadata, represented by an emblem that appears on the StarGarden itself. Overall there is a total of 20 factions, 39 dormant traits and 5 distinct levels of rarity.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wGEZrKt.png)\n\n> Each StarGarden possesses its own unique characteristics and emblem\n\nOn September 2nd 2021, a message was received signed 'Eluüne,' confirming that we are not, in fact, alone in the universe. Upon initial review, it seemed that the transmission was some kind of distress call. However, after further scrutiny and analysis, it is evident that the message is actually an invitation and causal gateway to an entirely different dimension. The subsequent decoding of the text has allowed humanity to catch a glimpse of 'the other side,' if you will. This event is what led to the revelatory discovery of the StarGardens!\n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/8y1VSCI.png)\n\n> The S.O.S Message received from 'Eluüne'\n\nA few days ago a teaser image appeared on Project Eluüne's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/projecteluune) revealing a javelin-wielding humanoid seemingly attacking an unseen target. Who (or what) is this mysterious being? Are they one of the inhabitants of a StarGarden? What strange occurrence of physics permits such impossible landscapes to manifest concretely? Hopefully these and many other burning questions will be answered in due course...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gi6172V.jpg)\n\n## The Mechanics of Far-Flung Dimensions\n\nLet's take some time to discuss a few of the features that will be included in Project Eluüne's upcoming game:\n\n- **Unlock and Craft Powerful Creatures** - Players collect creatures of ever-increasing power and scale, engage them in combat against enemies and/or competing StarGarden teams, and earn ingredients, in-game currency and materials in the process\n- **Trade Valuable Assets** - Players will earn different kinds of ingredients and materials each day. These ingredients are used by players to engineer rare creatures that can then be used in-game or sold to other players for profit\n- **Fight in Epic Battles** - Players initiate quest battles and find themselves pitted against creatures of the world (PvE). They may also engage in tribal battles against other StarGardens (Tribe vs. Tribe, or TvT for short). The latter are full-blown (up to) 40-on-40 player battles with multiple creatures per player, resulting in massive contests with hundreds of creatures. Strategy and coordination will be of paramount importance, meaning that underdogs can defeat more powerful teams if they employ the appropriate tactics\n\nThese are just some of the features that have been discussed, and to put it mildly—they sound totally epic! If you want to read the full blog post that dives into Project Eluüne's gameplay, you can check it out [here](https://medium.com/@Arrivant_/stargarden-the-gameplay-bf6e50050de0).\n \n## Operation: Roadmap\n\nThe Project Eluüne Roadmap is divided into 8 Operations which encompass the official mint launch, some intriguing lore, interdimensional missions and much, much more. For your convenience, the details of each Operation are available for review below.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9PZzUFo.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HrTwims.png)\n\n> This Roadmap may evolve and is subject to change at any time. Little is known about this new world, and there's no telling what may be found there. All that is certain is that it’s going to be awesome!\n\nThere really is a lot to unpack with Project Eluüne. I must confess that I'm supremely excited to see what the team has planned and just how the Play-to-Earn game will function once it's available for testing. The concept and Roadmap are very interesting, and it seems like some of the mechanics within Project Eluüne are entirely original and something that I haven't really heard of before.\n\n## Stellar Stats\n\nProject Eluüne is due to commence its first official Operation very soon! To get your hands on and mint one of the 7,027 StarGardens, head over to their [website](https://www.arrivant.com/) on the day of their launch and have your wallet and SOL at the ready!\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information:*\n\n- **Total Items** - 7,027\n- **Mint Date** - 27/10/21\n- **Mint Price** - 3 SOL\n\nProject Eluüne is undoubtedly one of the most unique and innovative projects I've seen in this space so far. I have every confidence that their minting will go off without a hitch and am eager to see what the coming months have to offer. Be sure to follow Project Eluüne on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ProjectEluune/) and join their [Discord](http://discord.gg/eluune) to stay up-to-date with all the latest developments and get a first look at brand new content and features as they are released. That's it for today everyone...thanks for joining us for another amazing Discovery of the Day! And as Oscar Wilde once said:\n\n> *'We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars...'*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RKgniEf.jpg)\n\n***Disclaimer: Founding StarGarden NFTs are not to be seen or understood as investment vehicles of any kind or purchased for any kind of investment reason. Founding StarGardens are digital art collectibles that point to underlying media files of unique, non-fungible digital art. If you are interested in buying a Founding StarGarden NFT, you should only do so with the understanding that it is a digital art collectible and not an investment.

From Monday to Friday we bring you all our top picks for NFTs, DeFi protocols and Blockchain games. It's a spooky time of year, so this week we're looking at projects with a distinctly Halloween flavor. Today we are proud to present the refreshingly creepy Halloween Bears!***\n\n## (S)care Bears\n\nGreetings NFT enthusiast! I am sure you must be quite weary from all the shilling that takes place on popular social media sites such as 'The Twitter,' no? And just look at you! Wet through from that terrible storm raging outside! As the late Lord of the Manor once said to me, 'From time to time, we all need some respite.' Yes? Well worry not! This week on MSQ, we have plenty of comfortable beds for you to rest in...oh, what's that? These beds look more like coffins to you!? Oh heavens, don't be absurd! They're ergonomically shaped for your, uh...comfort! Believe me, our reputation is...impeccable.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PHF2l2i.gif)\n\nBefore we put you to rest, I mean, you lay down to rest, why not peruse our Mansion's extensive and resplendent Gallery? Now please, I don't want to hear anything about the eyes of portraits 'following you' as you walk, it's just your imagination. Ah, here we are... aren't these exquisite? [Halloween Bears](https://halloweenbears.io/) is a collection of 9,999 randomly generated NFTs lurching across the mortuaries of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. These exhumed ursas live in horrid harmony via a DAO, allowing their distant cousins to solemnly seek asylum should they require it. As much as I would love to purchase one of these undead bears simply for their shockingly stylish aesthetics, they do actually hold a most unusual utility for those that hold the keys to their reanimated state.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/42k7Bjv.gif)\n\n> What did I say? It's nothing! It's simply a trick of the mind. Now please, focus!\n\n### Staking (Careful Vampires!)\n\nHalloween Bears plan to implement staking (not the wooden kind) where holders of NFTs can stake their Bears in return for $SWEETZ, a utility token valued against the cumulative wealth of the DAO's assets (that is, all NFTs purchased by the DAO). $SWEETZ tokens have no monetary value in themselves, but they can be exchanged or 'burned' for various utilities (see the Halloween Bears Roadmap for upcoming utilities). To learn more about Staking and the tokenomics of $SWEETZ, visit the Halloween Bears [Discord](https://discord.gg/Afb9awZsTT).\n\n### Halloween DAO\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the team behind Halloween Bears formed a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) as part of their project. The Halloween Bears DAO initially formed to accumulate tokens from the popular Bears Deluxe project. The Halloween Bears DAO plans to accumulate 100 ETH worth of Bears Deluxe tokens prior to the implementation of staking. Once this has goal has been achieved, the DAO community will vote on future projects to invest in.\n\n### Analyzing Necrotic Nuances\n\nAnd of course we can't leave out how incredibly eerie these zombified bears look! Each Halloween Bear is made up from several different traits including outfits, faces, masks, backgrounds, headgear and more! Here's a small selection for you to take in:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/288cBFn.png)\n\n> Somewhere between a bat, a zombie and a duck-billed playtpus, we get this bear\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YxOcHx3.png)\n\n> Plague Doctor Bear forgot to lance his patient's Buboes :(\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xyENXuJ.png)\n\n> [Ki ki ki ma ma ma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6CUxxxs0JY)...\n\n## Horribly Ever After Halloween\n\nThe project is called Halloween Bears, but what happens once all the ghouls and ghosts have returned to their catacombs? Thankfully...plenty! The Halloween Bears Roadmap is jam-packed with events and features the creation of a committee, weekly AMAs with the project's developers and community leaders, staking (as I mentioned earlier), and Halloween celebrations that include a Halloween Trick-or-Treat Week. Last but not least, there's minting season-themed bears using $SWEETZ (be on the lookout for Christmas and other holiday events!) Here's the full Roadmap:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TOfpjUm.png)\n\n## Stupefying Stats\n\nThe Halloween Bears collection is currently sold out, but you can still grab one over on their official [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/halloweenbears) page.\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information:*\n\n* **Total Items** - 9,999\n* **Owners** - 2.6K\n\nThat draws this evening's viewing to a close. Now please, I must escort you to your room and ask you to deadbolt the door behind you...after all, you never know what nefarious things might be lurking in the hallways of our Manor. Oh, and do follow Halloween Bears closely.

We're taking a closer look at all things ghostly and ghastly as we wind up October and draw ever-closer to All Hallows' Eve. Today we bring you some Day-Glo Ghouls that will surely shock and amaze even the most adamant of skeptics: say Hello to Ethereals!**_\n\n## The Color In Our Space\n\nAh, so you survived the night...how fortunate. However, I imagine your sleep was a restless one. I have yet to hear of a guest who sleeps soundly through the night. Much like [H.P. Lovecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft), I often dream of vast cosmic vistas the likes of which no rational mind could countenance. In fact, I must confess that last night was no exception. Even now my mind is filled with lurid images of some brightly colored specters. In fact, they remind me very much of another series in our gallery. Follow me...\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HwHEMmb.gif)\n\nBe careful of the trees...our gardener has been absent of late\n\n</div>\n\nAnd here we are! [Ethereals](https://ethereals.wtf) is a collection of 12,345 ectoplasmic NFTs haunting the graveyards of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) Blockchain. These spectacularly spooky specters are hand-drawn and randomly generated using traits such as facial features, auras, arms, headgear, and protective sheets purposed to guard their cosmic forms from the harms associated with trans-dimensional travel. There are even several cultural references and super-insider rarities believed to have been conjured from the far reaches of the metaverse.\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/KyzYBsZ/ethereals.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n## Tickets to the FUN PARK\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rtKK2ul.png)\n\n</div>\n\nThe ETHEREAL FUN PARK is rumored to be located in a secret (and nearly impossible to find) remote patch of time and space. Those first to find and share the coordinates became known as 'the OGs.' However, park guests would need to face many more challenges before they could become 'RIDERS.'\n\nWhen the ETHEREAL FUN PARK was created, the park operators capped admission at 12,345 riders, reflecting the 1,2,3,4,5 seconds it takes to reach the top of the greatest roller coaster of all existence before dropping into blissful oblivion.\n\nUpon speaking the secret phrase and exiting the park, RIDERS activated their new ETHEREAL forms, granting them the power to travel inter-dimensionally in search of endless fun until the end of time.\n\n**'Where’s The Fun?'**\n\nTravelers initially used all manner of devices to arrive at the Fun Park. However, these approaches are not sustainable for infinite wormhole travel.\n\nUpon assuming their new forms, Ethereals receive sheets that not only protect their ectoplasm, but allow them to travel throughout all times and dimensions in search of FUN. These sheets are indicators of various states of travel and are clues to how active an ETHEREAL is or how long they have been traveling.\n\n**ETHEREAL FUN PARK OPERATORS**\n\nPark operators run the 'rides'—but the rides are far more than rides and the operators are far more than employees of the park. In fact, these rides are simply the most efficient forms for the 'operators' to process those that are worthy of being ETHEREAL.\n\nThe Ethereal Fun Park Operators have special powers and dominion over their specific areas in the park.\n\n* **Hydro Park Operators** - can bend and mold time\n* **Fire Park Operators** - can speed up time or destroy timelines all together\n* **Terra Park Operators** - can stop or grow timelines\n* **Air Park Operators** - can disintegrate time and parse it back together\n* **Space Park Operator** - has all the combined powers of all Ethereal Park Operators\n\nTogether they are able to create ETHEREALS through their combined park tech in the rides. Ethereal Park Operators are benevolent, but we don’t fully understand what their mission is yet. Only time will tell.\n\n**CHAOS OPERATORS**\n\nChaos Operators are loved fiercely by all but are far too powerful and erratic. The Ethereal Park Operators used all their powers collectively to subdue them. For everyone's safety, Chaos Operators have been tucked into the food court where they can roam freely and have fun.\n\nThey have an endless supply of power but very little discretion when it comes to using it...let's just say that when they have fun, they can go a little...wild. Thankfully they are unaware of their true strength.\n\nWhen overly excited, the 'popcorn' started to FLY! Each kernel of popcorn was a gift of power. The gifts they bestowed were 'popped' onto the other ETHEREALS at random which effectively created the 5 classes of Park Operators. Each was grateful for their newfound powers but had to take several steps to get the chaos under control.\n\nThanks to the Park Operators, the Chaos Operators can still use their powers, but only in a couple of areas of the park. It remains to be seen how long they will be subdued...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yXuzddh.gif)\n\n**ETHEREALTRONS**\n\nThe Etherealtrons are Delta (Water), Theta (Terra or Earth), Beta (Air) and Gamma (Fire). They are the creators of the Ethereal Fun Park Operators (EFP Staff) and Ethereal Fun Park Tech (the rides). The Etherealtrons imbued the Operators with their knowledge to create and maintain the ETHEREAL FUN PARK.\n\nIt’s important to note that Etherealtrons are not bound by a physical presence. They only choose to appear in forms easily understandable to lower life forms in order to communicate and assist them with their Ethereal ascension.\n\n## The Way Unto Ascension\n\nThe Ethereals Roadmap is filled to the brim with events, benefits and plans. Check out our graphic adaptation of their original Roadmap below (be sure to check the Ethereals website and Discord for regular updates as the Roadmap is subject to change at any time without prior notice).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/36Brqa7.png)\n\n## Spectral Stats\n\nAll 12,345 Ethereal NFTs have already been minted, but you can still pick some up on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/etherealswtf).

      "name": "Exploring the Goals of the NFTY Village Gaming Metaverse",
      "slug": "exploring-the-goals-of-the-nfty-village-gaming-metaverse",
      "body": "As we discussed in our [previous announcement](https://MSQ.io/blog/msq-announces-nfty-village-metaverse-featuring-nft-collection-loyalty-program-and-blockchain-game), NFTY Village is a gaming metaverse powered by blockchain and NFTs. Now you may be asking yourself, what does that even mean? Is it an NFT collection? A 10,000 generative PFP project? Is it just a game? What IS IT MAN?! In order to understand NFTY Village, we think it is first important to understand the goals we have for the project. \n\n### Goal #1: Family Friendly, Built for Everyone\n\nAt it's core, NFTY Village is a community building experiment. Not only that, but it is an intellectual property meant to be enjoyed by everyone. We want all of our community members to be able to participate and be a part of this journey together. \n\nAs a father, being able to share the joy of NFTs with my kids is important. Unfortunately, many projects feature art or communities that are simply inappropriate for a younger audience. Our first goal is to create NFT collections and an environment we consider family friendly. We will always strive to make NFTY Village something that everyone in your family can enjoy together. \n\n### Goal #2: A Collection for Any Budget, Even $0\n\nWe have noticed that a lot of collections tend to focus on one main launch and create a competitive gas war situation. This gas war causes a lot of supporters to miss out on the minting and forces them to buy at a higher markup in the secondary market. With NFTY Village, we want to take a different approach. We are putting a heavy focus on creating many different ways you can buy, earn, or win NFTs from our many upcoming collections. \n\nNFTY Village will feature traditional Mint Passes, a loyalty program that rewards exclusive NFTs for engagement, airdrops, contests, and many other ways you can earn NFTs regardless of your budget. Not only that, but we will have several collections available at any given time, ensuring we have something for everyone. \n\nWe will take a deeper look at our NFT Collections in an upcoming blog post, but rest assured, we will have a collection that fits any budget!\n\n### Goal #3: No Competitors, Just Future Partners\n\nAnyone who has followed our parent company (ARK.io) for a while knows this motto. It drives all of our efforts and NFTY Village will be no different. The Blockchain industry and NFTs as a result, are far too focused on competition and building isolated communities. There is room for all of us to succeed in this space but in order to do so, we have to focus on collaboration, not competition. That is why we built [MSQ](https://MSQ.io) in the first place! \n\nWe intend to use our existing relationships and reach across the aisle to bring some of our favorite projects together. NFTY Village won't just be Alpacas and it won't even just consist of NFTs we personally created. We intend to have our village represent the entire space and we hope to start announcing some really great partners soon. Don't be surprised if some of your favorite projects end up joining your village in the future! \n\n### Goal #4: It Has to Actually Be FUN!\n\nLet's face it, a lot of the fun has been sucked out of crypto. Tokens, DeFi, and NFTs have all devolved into investor this, VC that, and have become a game of maximizing ROI. We believe it can be more than that and we are 100% focused on bringing some of the fun back to our communities. We plan to do that through focusing on a positive environment, incentivizing engagement through our loyalty program, and making an NFT based Blockchain Game that actually focuses on just being fun rather than getting bogged down in complex economics and Play 2 Earn scam mechanics. \n\nJust like we said in goal #2, it's about being approachable and available to everyone. That includes the full gaming experience. It isn't going to cost you $300-$3,000 just to get your foot in the door. Not only that, but the baseline gaming experience will be fun without requiring the user to spend a single dime. That is our promise to you. \n\n### What Comes Next? \n\nWith these principles in mind, we are hard at work creating a true metaverse experience. From NFTs to Blockchain Gaming, we are building a fun, approachable, and family friendly vision that we think can work to bring communities together and create something far more than it's individual parts In our next blog post, we will take a deeper look into the various types of NFT Collections that will make up the NFTY Village Metaverse. \n\nUntil then, [**join our Discord**](https://discord.gg/VsQDrs8Q), [**follow us on Twitter**](https://twitter.com/NftyVillage), and check out the [**NFTY Village Gaming Metaverse**](https://NFTYVillage.com) on our newly launched website!

      "body": "_**We have officially made it to the halfway point in our Halloween NFT Special. From Monday to Friday, MSQ brings you some of our top picks from the worlds of Blockchain Gaming, NFTs and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Today we continue our theme of frightfully fun NFT projects that make for some spine-tinglingly good times. For Wednesday's Discovery of the Day, we present...Wicked Craniums!**_\n\n## Getting 'A Head' in the World of NFTs\n\nI hope the basement hasn't been too cold and damp for you dear traveler. And I certainly hope you haven't ventured too far into its depths. Rumor has it that the substructure of our Manor connects to an extensive network of caves that run deep under the crust of the Earth. I for one would be most upset if I found that you had disappeared without a trace. Oh I don't mean to frighten you of course, it's just that I have no idea what's down there...and to be honest, I'm surprised you're still here. You must be a special one! What? You want out? Oh very well, I'm not one to deny a person of their right to freedom, and besides...there's so much to explore!\n\nLet's take a little walk through the graveyard today. What do you say? It's not the best day for a walk here. Usually I enjoy watching the way the late morning sun filters through the gnarled and twisting trees to reveal the precise edges of the many mausoleums here. Sadly this dense fog that rolled in overnight has obscured most of the details. Most frustrating!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/C9PKh2G.gif)\n\n> Seems like there won't be any sun today...how unfortunate!\n\nThere's actually one particular Mausoleum I think you will thoroughly enjoy. Mind yourself now, it's a little dark. Allow me to light some candles...aaaand...there you have it! Take a look at these fascinating skulls we recently brought in from the Island of Osseous. This sample of [Wicked Craniums](https://wickedcranium.com/) is just a handful of the 10,762 Craniums that populate the catacombs of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain. Sadly we couldn't move them all and we don't technically own these...in fact, anyone who purchases a Wicked Cranium is its rightful owner, and nothing can change that.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/s7uhlvt.png)\n\n> The Wicked Craniums revolve around their tribal values, and the team behind the project hopes that you will align with them as well! The four core values of the Wicked Craniums Community are *Adventure*, *Mischief*, *Boldness*, and *Camaraderie*\n\nSo what exactly do these resurrected skeletons look like in their quasi-corporeal states? Observe these former occupants of the ossuary and judge for yourself!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/v5TYWpp.png)\n\n> Harold's propensity for Norse Mythology was starting to affect his work ethic\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4iHGzRF.png)\n\n> That nail is one tap away from being a total frontal lobotomy...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/i0FBcW9.png)\n\n> Gordon Ramsey regretted ordering the Extra Hot Vindaloo Curry\n\n### The Creators of Calcified Craniums\n\nAnd what of the minds behind these walking High School Biology Class features? Well, Wicked Craniums is a project by [Reckless Labs](https://twitter.com/reckless_labs), an initiative by [Doob](https://twitter.com/WickedDoob) and [Derb](https://twitter.com/WickedDerb), a dynamic duo driving in a drastically different direction. As the pair relates, this project is their way of showing others their 'weird little world.' The two describe themselves as curious individuals who enjoy talking about just about anything...and with angelic faces like these, how could you possibly turn down an opportunity to converse, hmm?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LO6Iz0o.png)\n\n> The newest diet had done wonders for Doob and Derb's self-confidence and medical bills\n\n### The Wicked Stallions\n\nThey say every horse needs a rider, but in the case of Wicked Craniums, it seems the opposite is true. Cranium holders were all permitted to mint a Wicked Stallion, a special companion for each of the Wicked Craniums, free of charge. That's right, every single Cranium holder was able to mint a Wicked Stallion for no charge whatsoever. Here's an example of one such skeletal steed:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gG92j5h.png)\n\n### Augmented Reality (AR) Filters\n\nUpon reaching 100% Roadmap Activation, Wicked Craniums launched a bunch of AR filters for Instagram. Taking a look at these 3D models, it's safe to say the end result is nothing short of bone-jarringly brilliant! Be sure to check them out when you get a chance...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ea5ayUG.png)\n\n## God Cranium Auction\n\nOn October 30th 2021 (just one day before Halloween), [The God Craniums](https://niftygateway.com/collections/wickedcraniumauctions), the first-ever 1/1 NFTs created by Reckless Labs, will be auctioned off via [Nifty Gateway](https://niftygateway.com/). 100% of the proceeds will go towards several charitable organizations that collaborated on this collection including [UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/), Acumen, Mercy Corps, Health Finance Institute, Red Cross and Sandclock Org in order to bridge the gap between DeFi and philanthropy. If you're lucky enough to win the bid for God Cranium, you will own the original version of the artwork and help towards a very noble cause indeed. Take a look at these magnificent specimens...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/O52MqHX.png)\n\n> From Top left to Bottom Right: Water, Fire, Air and Earth God Craniums\n\n## Too Much to Mention!\n\nMy dear traveler, this may come as a surprise to you, but the above is just the start with Wicked Craniums. Just a few of the areas that have either been explored or are about to be embarked upon include the following:\n\n- Staking\n- A Members Only Platform known as the Wicked Craniums Cradle\n- Community Wallet\n- Merchandise\n- Liquidity Pool\n- Wicked Craniums on [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/map/?liteMap=false&currentX=830&currentY=1470&zoom=1)\n- [A Theme Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/6DLulHXYImu96pP6HRsFab?si=1d2b8becc7774f23&nd=1)\n- And much much more...\n\nFor a list of what Wicked Craniums has already achieved and is currently working on, just visit their [official website](https://wickedcranium.com/).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CpBfobZ.png)\n\n> You have to admit, the WC merch is totally off the hook!\n\n## Skeletal Stats\n\nWicked Craniums dropped ton Sunday June 20th 2021 and sold out in just 32 minutes! So as you may have guessed, if you want a Wicked Cranium, you'll need to visit their [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/thewickedcraniums) page. Now how about some stats?\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\n\n- **Total Items** - 10,762\n- **Total Owners** - +4.5K *(most Craniums are staked, so OpenSea figure may differ)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/K1R5P3v.png)\n\nMy oh my, the fog has really rolled in. We'll need to stay in the nearby log cabin for tonight. Don't worry, it's quite safe...as long as you don't open the door, of course. As you may have guessed, our Manor is one of the largest around, and there are many parts to it. Now that we're safely at the cabin, you can take the time to follow Wicked Craniums on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WickedCraniums) and join their [Discord](https://discord.gg/yBYAdy8fqX) so that you don't miss a thing, and indeed that things don't miss you either...\n\nOnce again I bid thee a good night, weary traveler. I'll be in the next room should you need me...but my advice? Pull the covers over your head and don't mind any sounds you hear. The night is full of surprises, and you don't want to come face to face with them. Trust me...I know.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R1179pO.gif)\n\n> For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) on SubStack, and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar) on Twitter.\n\n*We will be hosting giveaways for eligible members on the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) every Friday at 3PM ET.

      "slug": "nfty-village-nfts-the-loyalty-collection",
      "body": "If you missed our first two blog posts, we introduced the [basics of NFTY Village](https://MSQ.io/blog/msq-announces-nfty-village-metaverse-featuring-nft-collection-loyalty-program-and-blockchain-game) and took a deeper look at the guiding principles and [goals of NFTY Village](https://MSQ.io/blog/exploring-the-goals-of-the-nfty-village-gaming-metaverse). Now that we have laid the foundation for what NFTY Village is all about, let's get down to the fun stuff! \n\nToday we will start mapping out the various types of NFT collections that make up the NFTY Village Metaverse (NVM). With NFTY Village, you will be able to buy, earn, and win a wide range of NFTs as we go on this epic adventure! In this blog post, we will take a look at our first launch, ***The NFTY Village Loyalty Collection***! \n\n## What is a Loyalty Collection? \n\nNFTY Village is about building a community that leaves no villager behind. We have put a large focus on ensuring that the NFTY Village Metaverse will be open to all types of users with no limiting factors to participation. One of the biggest complaints we have seen in the NFT space is that many collections are just too expensive. A large part of the community gets priced out of participation because, let's face it, $3,000 for an NFT is a LOT of money to most people. \n\nThat is why we are creating the NFTY Village Loyalty Collection. The Loyalty Collection will be a series of special edition Villagers, Pets, and Decor items only available through the NFTY Village Loyalty Program. These collections are not available to buy directly in a mint, they are not a part of the mint pass, and they will never be sold directly by us. The Loyalty Collection is only available if you earn it by engaging with and supporting both MSQ.io and the NFTY Village community. \n\n## How Do I Earn One? \n\nThe NFTY Village Loyalty Program will feature many different ways to earn NFTs over the course of each Journey. While we are not ready to fully release the specifics of the Loyalty Program, here are a few examples of the types of things we might include: \n\n- Join our Discord, Follow on Twitter\n- Be an OG Villager in Discord\n- Participate in Community Events\n- Sign-up for MSQ\n- Share news, events, or competitions\n- Engage on Social Media\n\nThese examples are just the beginning and we plan to develop and expand the NFTY Village Loyalty Program for years to come. The Journey to Alpacria is just the first Journey and we will have many opportunities to earn exclusive NFTs as we continue our adventures to new and mysterious lands. \n\n## What Collections Can I Earn? \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OMlJzHf.jpg)\n\n\nOur first NFTY Village Loyalty Collection will be the ***Halloween in Alpacria*** collection! This collection falls within the ***Journey to Alpacria*** and features a special Halloween themed collection of exclusive NFTs only available to those who participate and engage in our Halloween festivities. \n\nWe will announce more collections throughout the Journey to Alpacria and there will be many opportunities to get involved and earn some really exciting prizes! \n\n## How Do I Find Out More?!\n\nFor more information on the NFTY Village Loyalty Program and our NFT collections as a whole, make sure to [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/VsQDrs8Q), [Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NftyVillage), and keep an eye on the [blog at MSQ](https://MSQ.io/blog). \n\nThe Halloween festivities have already started in our discord and we have several contests and giveaways currently going on. Come and join us for your choice to earn your first NFTY Village NFTs and join us on this crazy adventure!",

      "slug": "deadheads-nfts-of-the-living-dead",
      "body": "***We're nearing the end of our Discovery of the Day Halloween Week, but that doesn't mean we're letting up on the scares or the amazing projects! MSQ is the home of all things decentralized and Blockchain related. From Monday to Friday we bring you all our top picks for NFTs, DeFi protocols and Blockchain games. Today we present...DeadHeads!***\n\n## Gone But Not Forgotten...\n\n*Wake up!* We need to leave *right now*! Something's in this cabin with us and we can't waste any time! Hurry now...don't look at it, whatever you do! Keep your head down and keep moving. That's it, eyes shut now!\n\nWell, I must say...that was a close shave weary traveler! Unfortunately we're now out here in the dark forest a ways from our Manor...and we're about to arrive at a sacred burial ground. Oh my! As it seems, we're already here! Now I must warn you, the little beasts that inhabit this site may seem harmless, but they've quite the attitude...and I'm quite sure some of them bite.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZYc3NCu.gif)\n\n> What unholy abomination throws the horns from beyond the grave!?\n                                            \nSo let me tell you a little bit about [DeadHeads](https://deadheads.io/), a creative project bringing a spark of innovation to the NFT space. In short, DeadHeads is the first-ever multimedia brand that gives verifiable ownership of its IP to its fan base via NFTs. The DeadHeads is a collection of 10,000 unique 3D animated collectibles featuring resurrected corpses at different levels of decomposition. There's a lot to dissect when it comes to DeadHeads, so prepare yourself!\n\nWhen you own a DeadHead, it comes with many perks including the ability to make and sell your own DeadHead merchandise and sub-license the rights to your NFT—in essence, you own a piece of the brand. Having true ownership is at the heart of DeadHeads, and that's something I personally appreciate dear traveler...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7jeh38H.png)\n\n> Think this little guy might be a fan of [Nile?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_(band))\n\n### Decentralizing Hollywood\n\nDeadHeads plans on producing its own animated series. Now that really is quite impressive! Collectors of DeadHeads will help shape the series by providing their input and thereby determining the vision of the series. This is NFT history in the making! You can watch the first episode of DeadHeads right [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVygJiV61vM). An intriguing component of DeadHeads' approach is the fact that they want to extend their content into traditional media platforms such as [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/TV/b?ie=UTF8&node=2864549011) while holders retain ownership of their characters in a fully decentralized model.\n\nDeadHeads is the result of some significant efforts by thought leaders and top developers in the NFT space. The main culprit behind this fiendish collection goes by the moniker [PAWSY](https://twitter.com/pawsy_bb). Curious!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yOEpiiI.png)\n\n> The Grim Reaper's little brother loves his golden sandals\n\n### Green Room\n\nThe Green Room is a piece of technology developed by the DeadHead team that allows people to collect rare assets from the animated series. So how does it work, you ask? After every episode of the animated series, the 'Green Room' will open up, revealing limited edition items available for enthusiasts to collect. In other words, it's a viable method for collectors to gather pieces of history from the show! Fantastic! I'm sold! I can't say I've ever heard of something quite as unique as this before.\n\nSo how does one access the Green Room? In order to do so, a user needs to hold a 'Dead Ticket.' This allows any ticket holder to access the Green Room and mint assets. Take note that a Dead Ticket can only be used once, and upon minting an asset, a user's Dead Ticket will be *burnt*. Muhahahaha! So yeah, you can buy Dead Tickets [here](https://opensea.io/collection/deadtickets)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Itt4hVC.png)\n\n> Skull Trooper General Alisie knows exactly how [William Tell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tell) feels...\n\n## The Road to Hell is Paved with...Awesome Stuff!\n\nDon't worry, weary traveler! The DeadHeads have *much* planned for you and their fans! The DeadHeads Roadmap 2.0 includes many wondrous features such as (spooky drum roll):\n\n- **The DeadHeads November 1st NYC Event** where [Ghxsts](https://twitter.com/Ghxsts), [Dario](https://twitter.com/Dario_Desiena), [Pop Wonder](https://twitter.com/PopWonderNFT), and other big NFT artists will appear in an immersion room/bar\n- **The Skull Trooper Drop** (coming November 2nd) \n- The creation of the **Casting Pool** (where holder can stake their DeadHeads to be selected by the project's writers to appear in the upcoming show/movie)\n- **The Great Cremation** where DeadHeads holders can burn a DeadHead and revive an evolved version of it\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/T0PARTz.jpg)\n\n### Skull Troopers Drop\n\nHere's a sneak peek at the upcoming Skull Troopers Drop taking placed on November 2nd 2021. All funds received through this initiative will go towards the production of a Hollywood feature film! Spectacular!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cbjNKfi.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tdlEldk.png)\n\n## Defibrillator, Stat(s)\n\nThe DeadHeads collection is sold out, but you can still grab yourself one (or more) of these spooky d00dz over on the project's [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/deadheads) page. Check out some cursory stats below!\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\n\n* **Total Items** - 10K\n* **Owners** - 3.3K\n\nAnd with that dear traveler, the ritual is complete! All of the DeadHeads have been resurrected and walk the Earth. Now follow me, we need to venture to our final destination. You want to know what it is? I'm afraid I cannot tell you just yet...for now, I implore you to keep tabs on our friends by following DeadHeads on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DeadHeadsNFT) and joining their [Discord](http://discord.gg/deadheads). Can you imagine what those creatures will get up to if we don't monitor them closely? Perish the thought!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9mgIchZ.png)\n\nThe night is cold, weary traveler, and these past few days have been trying on you. I'm impressed you've retained your sanity. Stay close and don't wait for the sun to rise as we are in a place where it simply doesn't. I'm sure you're confused, but all will be revealed soon enough. Until then, don't stray off the path...I'd hate to lose you when we're so close to this Halloween journey's end...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vNhhNth.gif)\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) on SubStack, and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar)* on Twitter.\n\n*We will be hosting giveaways for eligible members on the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) every Friday at 7PM UTC.

From Monday to Friday we bring you all our top picks for NFTs, DeFi protocols and Blockchain games. For the last NFT feature before Halloween rolls around, we present 0xVampire!***\n\n## Shadows Out of Time [💀](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Out_of_Time)\n\nWell my dear friend, I have some excellent news! We are no longer in a dark and foreboding forest! However, we are now several years in the future...yes, I know it's confusing. As it turns out, we've stepped through some sort of time portal and are now in the year 2025. I must also inform you that a strange infection is having an adverse effect on the inhabitants of this realm. No, it's not *that* infection. Still, you need to be very careful if we're to find our way back to our own timeline. Quickly now, let's move!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8N3UATY.gif)\n\n> This place looks terribly unnatural to me...\n\nNow as I mentioned, this is the year 2025, and the Metaverse is no longer a theoretical construct. In this world, people are quite at home with living in a virtual space using their NFT identities. In many ways, the world is peaceful here, and there is a sense of order and balance. Unfortunately there's the matter of that infection I told you about...well, it's actually a super virus known only as 0x. Those who are infected generally display no symptoms, but when the moon rises, bizarre things start to transpire. Any infected parties will undergo several physiological changes during this time including the growth of sharp fangs and bat ears. Moreover, these individuals become particularly attuned to the presence of blood. These beings are known only as [0xVampires](https://0xvampire.io/).\n\nThankfully the only real changes observed within contaminated subjects is their appearance. Other than the aspects mentioned above, everything else seems to be entirely under control. Having said this, it is unclear what may happen if the 0xVampires can no longer resist their thirst for blood or if the virus continues to mutate over time. This is just the beginning, and much is yet to be revealed...\n\n### No Reflection in the Mirror\n\nSensitivity to sunlight, the need to drink fresh blood and the inability to see their own reflection in a mirror (or anywhere really) are just some of the most well-known tropes of vampires. 0xVampires consists of 9,999 randomly generated NFT characters all walking the dark backstreets of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain. Each 0xVampire is derived from over 200 hand-drawn traits, meaning that every single character is 1/1 unique and capable of being customized.\n\nThe team behind this darkly imaginative project are Project Leader 0xDylan, Artist 0xVic and Developer 0xSillyfish. Now let's take a look at some samples of this fantastic collection below...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Em4HTcj.jpg)\n\n> Maria was less than impressed with her ETH Logo choker\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MnxL4Xu.jpg)\n\n> Is there anything more vampiric than wireless headphones and a scowl?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/u4zkTIk.jpg)\n\n> Alicia decided to knock off early from her accounting job at the Blood Bank...\n\n## Toadbat, I Mean, Roadmap\n\n0xVampires realizes that it must appease the vampires of this world and thus have much in store for the denizens of the dark. The following graphic is adapted from their original Roadmap which you can find directly on their website or in their official [Discord](https://discord.gg/zMkXsWt4).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ExBUyLv.png)\n\n### 0xHunter\n\n[0xHunter](https://0xhunter.io/) is a sequel and counterpart to the 0xVampire project. Only 8,888 Hunters, randomly generated from over 200 hand-drawn traits, will be available for minting. In fact, the Public Sale is due to begin on October 29th 2021, just two days before Halloween!\n\nThere are seven different kinds of Hunters, namely *Rioters*, *Hybrids*, *Witchers*, *Demonhunters*, *Valkyries*, *Cyborgs* and *Ninjas*. Check out some samples below:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TnuSLSK.jpg)\n\n> A Rioter\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2JC7vdP.jpg)\n\n> A Witcher\n\nMake sure you're ready for these to drop, because if the 0xVampire sale is anything to go buy, these will probably disappear in no time at all! If you're fortunate enough, you'll be able to nab a 0xHunter before it's too late—just make sure you're prowling the website and ready to go if you want to stand a fighting chance!\n\n## Stats on the Children of the Night\n\n0xVampires sold out in two minutes flat, but thankfully you can buy one (or even several) of these futuristic fiends via the project's [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/0xvampire-project) page.\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\n\n* **Total Items** - 9.9K\n* **Owners** - 4.3K\n\nWell it seems we've found a portal back to our time...best we depart now lest we find ourselves stuck here forevermore. Jump in now! While we're on our way back, I suggest that you follow 0xVampire on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xVampireNFT) and join their [Discord](https://discord.gg/zMkXsWt4) so that you don't miss any news about what's going on in the 0xVerse. If you aren't careful you may find yourself drained of life, or if one of those Hunters mistakes you for a Vampire, well...need I say more?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Y8s44dn.png)\n\nAnd we're back home in our Manor! Quite miraculous that we survived all that! Unfortunately it looks like you won't be leaving anytime soon, dear traveler. In fact, *you* are now part of our Gallery...forever! Don't scream, no one can hear you! In fact, to me...you aren't moving at all! Muhahaha! Well, I must be going...many more projects to explore and many more travelers to add to my collection! Fare thee well old friend...and ***Happy Halloween!***\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0HrWrF6.gif)\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) on SubStack, and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar)* on Twitter.\n\n*We will be hosting giveaways for eligible members on the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) every Friday at 7PM UTC.

From Monday to Friday we bring you some of our top picks from across the cryptosphere and give you all the latest info on each one! Today we proudly bring you Metasaurs!***\n\n## Splicing 'n Dicing with Dr. DMT!\n\nI'm no [Michael Crichton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton), but if books and movies like [Jurassic Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)) are anything to go by, genetic engineering often leads to...undesirable consequences. Oh sure, it's all fun and games when your dinosaur petting zoo has electricity, but as soon as [Wayne Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Knight) decides to disable the park systems and make off with your prized embryos, things quickly go from Tyranno-tastic to, well, Doyouthinkhesaurus doo-doo. Whatever the case, there's one thing we all know for sure..\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1P9j2wk.gif)\n\n[Metasaurs](https://www.metasaurs.com/) is a genetically modified NFT collection of Dino-Ape hybrids residing in the laboratories of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain. There are 9,999 unique Metasaurs that have been computer generated by the provably rare Dr. DMT. So who's this mad scientist we speak of? Well, Dr. DMT is an authentic Bored Ape from the [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/). The mustard on his tank top is actually MetaDNA chemicals from his experiments in 'The Lab!' Dr. DMT says Bored Apes need companions too, so this is why he decided to create Metasaurs. Each Metasaur is randomly generated from over 200 hand-drawn traits, with each individual NFT consisting of between 3 and 7 combined traits of various rarities.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qLiSo3m.png)\n\n> The ape, the myth, the legend...Dr. DMT!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zBgvNzw.png)\n\n> Metasaurs are a genetic hybrid between a T-Rex and BAYC Ape #4588\n\nSo let's take a closer look at the results of this crazy genetic cross-breeding, shall we? 👀\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Mtx40Cm.png)\n\n> Kinda makes me think of the [Night King](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Night_King) from [Game of Thrones](https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GvFnsHy.png)\n\n> Never mind opening your third eye, this Metasaur has every eye open!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VihC6ZG.png)\n\n> [Scorpion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion_(Mortal_Kombat)) from [Mortal Kombat](https://www.mortalkombat.com/) as a Metasaur?

      "slug": "what-the-mekaverse-has-taught-us-about-the-nft-space",
      "body": "**The world of NFTs, much like crypto as a whole, is a volatile space. The controversy surrounding the MekaVerse has left many avid NFT collectors embittered while others continue to defend the project despite what has transpired. However, if we take a closer look and consider the timeline, there are valuable lessons to be learned here...**\n\nIf you’re an avid participant or follower of the NFT craze that has taken over so many of our lives in recent months, you’ve surely heard of [the MekaVerse](https://www.themekaverse.com/)—and probably have opinions about it.\n\nThe MekaVerse is an NFT project that was previewed long before its mint, featuring crisp 3D artwork of robotic mechs. The renderings, in stark contrast with the simplistic and cartoon-style artwork most popular NFT projects utilize, led to the MekaVerse releasing one of the most anticipated, if not *the* most anticipated, NFT minting to ever occur.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/y1kj3qZ.png)\n\n> Clean high-definition renderings like this Meka had thousands of enthusiasts salivating\n\nWith a waiting list reportedly in the hundreds of thousands, early floor predictions for the project hovered around the 10 ETH mark. While there are many projects that boast more impressive floors, none did so with the same immediacy of the MekaVerse. [Bored Apes](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/) and [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) spent months, even years below a floor of that level, which begs the question—why should we anoint Mekas such value before we’ve even seen them? While a typical NFT minting holds an excitement for the future potential of the project—the building of community, use cases for the artwork, and ultimately, potential to amass great amounts of ETH—the MekaVerse mint felt more like entering a Powerball lottery.\n\n## The Minting\n\nI will never forget the night of the minting. Out at dinner with friends, I had missed the initial launch, and had no way to check if I had won until I got home to my laptop. On the subway, I thought about all the ways that minting and selling two Mekas, worth a potential $80,000, would change my life. It’s a feeling that largely keeps me in the NFT space even after bad investments or disappointment. And I believe, more than the project’s artwork or Roadmap, that feeling is why the MekaVerse encapsulated the NFT space to begin with.\n\nShortly after mint, which I did not participate in, Mekas that had yet to be unveiled were selling for around 6 ETH. The 10 ETH floor seemed within the realm of possibility after their unveiling, and any eager buyers who missed out on mint rolled the dice on buying into the project.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/L6p19hI.gif)\n\n> Now the song is stuck in your head. You're welcome!\n\nAfter delays in the unveiling, the conspiracies began. There were rumors the mint raffle had been rigged, and now, people were saying that the devs were programming the rarest traits for themselves and their companions. What had started as one of the most promising NFT projects of all time had gone south quickly, and after the unveiling, the floor price reflected this. At the time of writing, the current floor is close to 1 ETH.\n\n## A Total Failure?\n\nThat’s not to say, of course, that the project was not a success by some measures. It’s currently the number one project on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) by trade volume, and the devs can examine what went wrong atop the large pile of money they’ve made in the past two weeks.\n\nFor casual NFT connoisseurs like myself, there’s something comforting about the failure of the MekaVerse in its quest to become the next Bored Ape Yacht Club or CryptoPunks. I’ve always believed that the best NFTs have an intangible value that can’t be determined by the detail of its artwork or specificity of its Roadmap.\n\nFrom the moment of its inception, the MekaVerse felt confrontational. After mint, you could find buyers defending the project on Twitter, often putting down other communities in the process. *'Your Lazy Lion will never be worth more than my Meka,'* one Twitter user wrote. It did not take long for them to stand corrected...\n\nUltimately, the MekaVerse should serve as a reminder that the potential for financial gain can only take a project so far. And while the MekaVerse failed to tend to the other aspects of a successful NFT community—honesty, integrity, creativity—its story is able to serve as a reminder of how to *not* handle hype.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Dy1w5V6.gif)",

From Monday to Friday we bring you all our top picks from across the cryptosphere and take great care in ensuring you're entertained throughout! Today we cast our eyes skywards as we bring you...SpaceBoys!***\n\n## To InfiNFTy, and Beyond!\n\nAh yes, the glorious cosmos in which our tiny little blue planet floats is truly extraordinary. No matter how many times you look up at the night sky, it's always mind-boggling to think that all that darkness goes on...well, pretty much forever. There are so many movies and stories about space exploration. From [Stanley Kubrick's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick) [2001: A Space Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)) to [Christopher Nolan's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan) [Interstellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)), many movies have asked that burning question, *'Just what in the Sam Hill is going on here!?'*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DdlbMNc.gif)\n\n> 'Just what do you think you're doing Dave?''\n\nAnd this brings me to our delightful Discovery of the Day that's more solid and airtight than an unbreached starship's hull—[SpaceBoys](https://www.spaceboys.fun/) is 'an experimental generative NFT project' floating through the Galaxies of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain. As the site itself declares, Spaceboys is an attempt to apply new strategies and approaches to creating fun and engaging experiences for a community that loves novelty with 8,888 totally fresh spacemen NFTs.\n\nSpaceBoys offers holders an interesting royalty incentive:\n\n> Once all NFTs have been sold, 7% of all fees will be allocated as follows:\n>\n> - 3% to the holders' treasury in order to buy back NFTs\n> - 2% to the holders' treasury for marketing purposes, and\n> - 2% to the project founder and team\n\nSince the collection has already sold out, these royalty fees should have already been paid out or apportioned as promised. For more information about this and other benefits, be sure to visit SpaceBoys on their official [Discord](https://discord.gg/jvVm9HZp) and enquire there.\n\n*Please note that the above information is quoted from their official website and has been confirmed by their team to be accurate at the time of writing.*\n\nNow, what about the NFTs themselves? Well, put on your spacesuits and take a look!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b4los0T.png)\n\n> According to new regulations, you have to wear a mask in *all* environments\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bv7kszc.png)\n\n> I Yabba Dabba Don't want to be this guy in Deep Space!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cCUY557.png)\n\n> Bat wings, [Elton John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_John) sunglasses, Hawaiian shirt...you need nothing else!\n\n## Interplanetary Roadmap\n\nSpaceBoys has already hit a couple of milestones (Phase 1 - Moon and Phase 2 - Mars have already been completed). However, these free-willed spacefarers aren't done by any means! Check out what they still have planned for holders below...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hsQM9bg.png)\n\n## Supernova Stats\n\nIt should come as no surprise that SpaceBoys completely sold out in about 2 hours! That means you can no longer mint one. But fear not! If you want to grab a SpaceBoy, just head over to their [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/spaceboysnft) page and purchase one (or 2, or maybe 3?). And now for some number crunching...\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\n\n* **Total Items** - 8.9K\n* **Owners** - 4.3K\n\nThat's just about it for this fun little spacewalk of ours. Personally I think these cosmic characters are all that and a bag of dehydrated astronaut snacks. So yeah, if you want to roll with the SpaceBoys, make sure you follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SpaceBoysNFTs) and join their [Discord](https://discord.gg/jvVm9HZp) so that you don't miss out on any crazy cosmonaut capers! We're Earthbound now and the skies are a beautiful blue today. Until we meet again my friends, stay safe and wear your seat belt when exiting the atmosphere!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ddx7O4c.png)\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) on SubStack, and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar)* on Twitter.\n\n*We will be hosting giveaways for eligible members on the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) every Friday at 7PM UTC.

      "name": "NFTY Village NFTs: The Mint Pass Collection",
      "slug": "nfty-village-nfts-the-mint-pass-collection",
      "body": "If you missed our first blog post in the series, we talked about the [NFTY Village Loyalty Collection](https://MSQ.io/blog/nfty-village-nfts-the-loyalty-collection) and how we are focused on making NFTY Village inclusive for everyone. Not only that, but we actually airdropped our first collection, [Halloween in Alpacria](https://opensea.io/collection/nfty-village-loyalty-collection), to our OG Discord members on Halloween! While our loyalty collection is squarely focused on rewarding community members who positively engage and become pillars of the community, we also want to offer other ways to acquire exclusive NFTs. \n\nLet's face it, not everyone has the time to dive deep into the loyalty program and be active in the community. If that is you, todays' collection will be right up your alley! Let's take a look at one of our most anticipated drops, ***The NFTY Village Mint Pass***! \n\n### What is a Mint Pass? \n\nFor those who may not be familiar with the concept, a mint pass is like a membership card to a special club. By holding the membership card (a mint pass) you are entitled to special perks. Typically these perks include access to a members only chat and the ability to mint a special NFT collection or, in some cases, to mint during an exclusive presale period. While all mint passes are different, the basics are the same. No mint pass, no mint. \n\n### The NFTY Village Mint Pass\n\nFor the NFTY Village Mint Pass, we wanted to take the mint pass experience to the next level. If you think of NFTY Village in gaming terms, owning a NFTY Village Mint Pass is like subscribing to an MMO or buying a Fortnite battle pass. While everyone will have the chance to earn and win special edition NFTs, you are upgrading by buying a mint pass to gain access to exclusive, limited mints, as well as additional perks only available to mint pass holders. \n\nLet's take a look at some key factors that we think make the NFTY Village Mint Pass worth the upgrade.\n\n### Multiple Mint Pass Editions\n\nNFTY Village Mint Passes will come in multiple editions and each mint pass will encompass a unique Journey in the NFTY Village Metaverse. Our first mint pass will be the ***Nfty Village Mint Pass: Settlers Edition*** and will coincide with the ***Journey to Alpacria***. While this is the first NFTY Village Mint Pass, it won't be the only one we release. As each new Journey begins, we will release a new mint pass along with it. \n\nEach mint pass we release will be unique and provide access to a different collection of NFTs. These NFT collections will be within a given journey but will be exclusive to the mint pass. That means that while you can collect SOME of our NFTs through the loyalty program, the mint pass NFTs will only be available to mint pass holders. \n\n### One (1) Mint Pass; Four (4) Collections\n\nEach NFTY Village Mint Pass will allow the owner to mint four (4) NFTs in total from the corresponding collections. More specifically, the owner will be able to mint one (1) NFT from each of four (4) different event based collections assigned to their mint pass. These collections will be exclusive to the mint pass and unavailable anywhere else. \n\nThe four (4) collections that make up a mint pass will always be in the same journey. Our 1st journey is the \"Journey to Alpacria\" and all releases in the Settlers Edition Mint Pass will be taken from our experiences while exploring Alpacria. \n\nFor mint pass holders, all four (4) of the exclusive mints will be free and you will only be required to pay gas fees to mint your NFTs. \n\n### The Village Council (Members Club)\n\nBy owning a Settlers Edition Mint Pass you will gain access to the Village Council, a private members only club that will feature exclusive drops, giveaways, and members only events. We have a lot of surprises in store for our Mint Pass holders and the Village Council will be an exciting place for sure! \n\n### A Few More Suprises\n\nWhile we are excited to share everything with you, we want to keep some things a surprise! We have a lot planned for the Journey to Alpacria and the Mint Pass offers another chance to get unique villagers, pets, and in-game decor items that you can't get anywhere else. \n\nWe will be announcing the release date and initial sale of our Mint Pass soon so [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/pD5MMFwK), [Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NFTYVillage), and keep refreshing [NFTYVillage.com](https://nftyvillage.com/) to make sure you are one of the first to know!",

From Monday to Friday we bring you our top picks from everything Blockchain in the form of Discoveries of the Day. In today's edition we take a closer look at some floating NFTs from yesteryear...yup, it's Flowtys!***\n\n## 'Step Right Up! Step Right Up!'\n\nAh yes, you sir! And you madam! All of you actually! Yes indeed, we have some of the finest NFTs this side of the Pacific, imported from a very far-off and top secret location. That's right, we can't actually tell you where we found these whacky whatchamacallits, thaumaturgical thingamajigs or cantankerous incorporeal calamities, but we can tell you...they are indeed available. Now ask yourself, dear NFT owner, 'Whassa matter with my NFT? How am I opposed ta know that?' Well, it's a simple answer, isn't it my fizzling friends!? Quite simply...they don't *float.*\n\nWhy yes, thanks to the latest innovations in our patented technology, we can guarantee you, slap our knees and hope to Betsy, that your NFT floats and will remain floating for the rest of its existence (or inexistence, if you prefer?) To demonstrate the power of our product, I'd like you to stand over there madam, and uh, you over there my good man. Now hold still as we demonstrate the power of unbridled *levitation!*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7qrz0hf.gif)\n\n> Oh goodness...perhaps our gizmos are just a little *too* impressive!\n\nSo what do we call these gravity-defying marvels you ask? Why, [Flowtys](https://www.flowtys.com/) of course! Yes, Flowtys are the original and best aging 1920s-era NFT avatars. Sounds like a mouthful? Well we're just getting started! Let's call today 'Throwback Thursday,' shall we? [Flowtys](https://www.flowtys.com/) consists of 10,000 unique characters backed by NFTs on the omnipresent [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain. Believe it or not, every single Flowty is animated and drawn by hand! Come on! You can't tell me that isn't impressive!? Rest assured, all common, rare and super rare Flowtys that have been distributed have been done so in a completely fair and random manner. You have my word on that!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/F9LrhMK.gif)\n\n> Just makes me want to dance the Charleston!\n\n### Web3? Sounds Good to Me!\n\nFlowtys is not only just an awesomely original PFP project. No, in fact, it's a Web3 company delivering outstanding Web3 experiences to its holders. Observe the following stats:\n\n![](twitter:poopeye_nft/status/1450939821694857223)\n\n### A Stand for Public Domain\n\nNow I know you won't be prepared for this next revelation! Here it goes...Flowtys NFT owners have **full** commercial rights to the Flowtys they hold! Is that not simply spellbinding my good people?\n\n> 'This project is a love letter to the art and critique on the company spending Millions of Dollars to extend copyright terms while licensing public domain goods, exploiting our cultural heritage.'\n\n### Aging Concept\n\nWait, there's more! A special part of Flowtys is the aging component. The longer someone holds a Flowtys NFT, the older it gets...literally! No, this isn't some ghoulish gimmick or contrived contraption! Flowtys takes a retrospective look some one hundred years ago! The team behind these characters was inspired to create Flowtys to highlight the simpler times when all art and media was 'analogue.' Having said this, they've also taken advantage of the unique opportunity Blockchain tech provides to alter artwork over time...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eQj7Lm1.png)\n\n> Desirable degradation! From crystal clear to Nickelodeon nuance in a matter of months!\n\n### Flowtys Studio\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3Z90Bl0.jpg)\n\nFlowtys/Morphys owners can access [The Flowtys Studio](https://studio.flowtys.com), a creative space where they can do some really fun things with their NFTs including the following:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gKvXjzF.png)\n\n> Create a Twitter Banner\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sSRpNvY.png)\n\n> Create a Wallpaper for their Smartphone\n\nUsing the Flowtys Studio, holders can also create a promo GIF using their Twitter username.\n\n### Flowtys+\n\nAh, the Golden Era of Cinema! [Greta Garbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Garbo), [Rudolph Valentino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_Valentino), [Norma Shearer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Shearer)...oh, but I digress! Flowtys has what they call 'Flowtys+,' a free streaming service for owners of Flowtys/Morphys or Golden Tickets. All the content here is within the Public Domain license, so it's completely free to use!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ePQsY7x.gif)\n\n> A short preview of the Flowtys+ streaming service\n\n### What About the Flowtys Themselves?\n\nFlowtys possesses many unique features and offers plenty of utility to its holders. Now prepare your eyes and ears for a sensory overload as we finally cast our peepers on these good old floating friendlies...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MsQJTx9.png)\n\n> That's quite the unicorn horn for a cartoon cow, ain't it?

Some highlights include the Golden Cinema Grand Opening, exclusive NFT & merch drops, a vote for holders and much, much more. Just take a gander below at the full Roadmap and be sure to join the Flowtys [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/MSG2bSjMff) so that you don't miss a single update!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aoUgRz4.png)\n\n### Morphys\n\nOh but he magic has yet to run out folks! [Morphys](https://flowtys.com/morphys) are free for Flowtys holders from a week after mint. A user may mint a twin of their Flowty NFT according to a given 'season.' Halloween was the first season, and next will be Christmas. If someone holds a Morphy already, they can shift the appearance of their Morphy to the new season if they so desire. In short, Morphys are able to change their appearance or 'morph.'

      "body": "***The past few months have seen a wide assortment of projects being covered here on MSQ, and we're not letting up anytime soon! We bring you Discoveries of the Day from Monday to Friday featuring our top picks from across the cryptosphere. From DeFi protocols to NFT collections, you can find it all right here on MSQ. Today we bring you a particularly unique collection by James Shedden—The Pluto People!***\n\n## The Science of Form\n\nYou've probably heard that old argument about people who are left-brained being particularly logical and better at subjects like mathematics and physics while right-brained people are more creative, emotional and artistic in nature. Although there seems to be sufficient evidence to corroborate this notion, not every theorist agrees with this rather reductive approach to human cognitive behavior. Indeed, no human being is entirely rational; neither are they completely emotional and/or capricious (unless extreme cases are taken into account, of course).\n\nYou may be wondering why I've opted for this rather verbose preamble, but humor me a little longer, will you? Art may be subjective, but in the truest sense, even the most chaotic stream-of-consciousness pieces have a semblance of form and order. If one considers the work of [Jackson Pollock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock), which relies heavily on creative accident and chance, there is clear evidence of direction, purpose and decision-making within his artworks—certain colors had to be picked, limitations of the medium and method had to be observed, and in the end, there is a deliberateness in even the most 'unartistic' of art pieces.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bo1ToOc.jpg)\n\n> Pollock's *Number 31* (1950) may be chaos, but it is *ordered* chaos\n\nNow we're all aware that much classic art is typically hyper-detailed, or at the very least, based on proven techniques related to form, composition, lighting, texture and color. Today's NFT collection, [The Pluto People](https://twitter.com/PlutoPeopleNFT), is more reminiscent of modern cubist renderings by the likes of [Pablo Picasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso) or [Georges Braque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Braque) than anything else. However, even this appraisal is limiting as elements of classic Greek sculpture, Futurism and even Art Nouveau are present within these NFTs by London-based artist [James Shedden](https://twitter.com/jamesshedden).\n\nWhile I can't attest to his exact influences, Shedden's choices regarding composition, lighting, brushstrokes and geometry evoke an oddly familiar feeling of warmth and nostalgia, almost as though you are intimately acquainted with each of his characters in some way. The end result is that each of his pieces contains a wealth of intriguing detail and a refreshingly human aspect that photo-realistic projects simply lack despite their morphological clarity. In many ways, The Pluto People feels more like a dream or pleasant memory than a series of generative characters or avatars. This is why, to my mind, it is a particularly fascinating collection and is more akin to fine art than pop culture.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/x3WYgQj.gif)\n\n> Subtle animation in pieces like *Cyclist* imbue Shedden's work with an inimitable kinetic quality\n\nAs you can well imagine, The Pluto People focuses sharply on art and authentic storytelling. You'll be pleased to know that the collection will launch on the [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) Blockchain. Naturally, there are a few reasons for this judicious decision:\n\n* It significantly reduces gas fees,\n* It's eco-friendly since Polygon uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, and\n* It's compatible with [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/)\n\nWhile James may be the artist behind The Pluto People, he receives a significant amount of assistance from his partner [Walt](https://twitter.com/waltfy), a software engineer who handles the more technical aspects pertaining to Blockchain technology and effectively helps bring The Pluto People to life! This said, James is handling much of the technical details himself including all of the generative code responsible for producing each 'Pluto Person.' Remember what I said about left- and right-brain dichotomy being limiting?\n\n## Geometric Intrigue\n\nAnother key component of The Pluto People is its strong drive to build a friendly, active and creative community. With each sneak peak that is released, followers are coming up with new theories and ideas regarding The Pluto People and their way of life. In fact, the community encourages others to join in and provide their own opinions and observations about exactly what these fascinating humanoids are up to.\n\nNow let's take some time to check out a few of the sneak peaks that have been released via The Pluto People's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PlutoPeopleNFT) thus far:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vNeGy13.jpg)\n\n> Is it a museum? A storage area? And what about the glyphs on the wall?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aaIUVcY.gif)\n\n> Colorful, friendly and mysterious...what are they thinking about?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pVkCGqI.gif)\n\n> So there's trees and liquid water on Pluto after all!\n\n## A Map of Pluto?\n\nThe Pluto People is still a very new project and, to my understanding, the team has yet to release an official Roadmap. However, James and Walt are hard at work to get everything in order, and I couldn't be more excited to see what they have planned for the future!\n\nIf you would like to find out more about The Pluto People, simply join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/theplutopeople) and check out their suitably detailed FAQ section. Any questions or thoughts you may have should be covered there. Naturally, if there is anything else you would like to know, simply ask in the appropriate channel, and someone will almost certainly address your query.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oDs7mWA.gif)\n\n> Not just a cold and lonely Dwarf in the Dark...\n\n## Quality Comes First!\n\nAs aforementioned, The Pluto People collection is still being built and has not officially released as yet. However, I strongly urge you to keep a lookout by following them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PlutoPeopleNFT/header_photo) and joining their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/theplutopeople) so that you get all the latest developments and information delivered directly to you on a consistent basis.\n\nAt present The Pluto People community is relatively small, but it's clear that its members are highly motivated and active. In the coming weeks and months, I have little doubt that this project will become a major drawcard for many NFT collectors and enthusiasts. In its short lifespan, The Pluto People has already garnered a lot of attention and released some very impressive work to say the very least. So keep your ears and eyes peeled! You do *not* want to miss this one! Thanks for joining me on this Discovery of the Day. Take care, and personally?\n\n***...Pluto is still a planet to me...***\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UyxE6ew.jpg)\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) on SubStack, and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar)* on Twitter.\n\n*We will be hosting giveaways for eligible members on the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) every Friday at 7PM UTC.

      "body": "***Given how things are going in the NFT space, we here at MSQ decided it's high time to put together a little NFT Survival Guide to help both new and seasoned NFT enthusiasts to navigate the turbulent world of NFTs with a little more confidence. For this reason, in place of today's Discovery of the Day, we bring you some useful checks and procedures to apply before committing to any kind of NFT-based project. Let's get into it!***\n\n## Rise of the Scamsters\n\nA couple of weeks ago I was approached by an NFT creator on Discord regarding a new NFT project by the name of [MetaBulls](https://metabulls.io/). I was a little taken aback because it was the first time an NFT creator had actually approached me about covering their project. Moreover, they were quite aggressive in their pitch and even wanted to compensate me for creating a detailed video about MetaBulls. Naturally I declined the offer and simply stated that I would be happy to look into their project and create a Discovery of the Day for free. At first they seemed a little displeased, but after showing them an existing MSQ article, they seemed satisfied. I informed one of my more experienced colleagues at MSQ about the offer, to which they replied, 'Just be careful Brynn...some of these projects could be scams.'\n\nI thought this reply somewhat odd but couldn't really shirk it off. I had scheduled the Discovery of the Day for MetaBulls to coincide with their launch day, which, if memory serves, was October 11th 2021. I had joined their Discord prior to commencing further research on the article and found the number of announcements and general activity strange, even disconcerting. Anyway, when the time came to finally look closer into the project, I checked out their website, their team and their upcoming 'game.' Needless to say...I started getting cold feet.\n\nI then proceeded to look them up on YouTube and actually found someone who had covered them. I checked out the comments on the video talking about how terrible the devs were and how it was a rug pull...not a good sign at all. I then decided to look around Twitter and saw the same sentiments being echoed there. Probably the factor that really turned me off the project the most was their so-called 'game' that they claimed to have *already* developed. Look at this...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1hsPAy3.jpg)\n\n> If you actually saw the 'gameplay' video from this, you'd know it's a load of Meta-Bull\n\nA project that had just launched with an already complete game and anonymous devs with no social media links? And a 'Roadmap' that was poorly written and only posted in their Discord? Nope. I was *out!*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Xgvh8yr.gif)\n\n> What's faster than a speeding rug pull? Me dropping MetaBulls, of course...\n\nI momentarily forgot about MetaBulls, and, a few days later, I found out that their Twitter and Discord had been deleted...it was an out and out rug pull. I also need to draw your attention to this great post-rug analysis by [Matty](https://twitter.com/DCLBlogger) which is one of the first posts I encountered after the MetaBulls Rug Pull. It has also served to inform much of the content within this survival guide, so thanks and kudos where it is due:\n\n![](twitter:DCLBlogger/status/1449985181821980673)\n\n## Life After Death?\n\nThe MetaBulls [website](https://metabulls.io/) is still up and running (for now) and, if viewed in the right light, is an excellent case study for anyone wanting to improve their skills when evaluating NFT projects. That said, MetaBulls is by no means a particularly sophisticated rug pull. Chances are also good that, as we get smarter as collectors and enthusiasts, these scams will inevitably become more nuanced and harder to spot. For this reason, to my mind, Rule 1 is:\n\n> If *anything* about a project gives you the heebie-jeebies...Do. **NOT.** Get involved!\n\nYup, it doesn't actually matter what everyone else says. All your friends like it? Everyone says it's gonna moon? While it's tempting to buy into hype, you absolutely *don't* have to. Does it mean you could miss out on some opportunities? Certainly. Does it also mean you might make some really good calls and protect your hard-earned crypto in the process? Also, certainly. At the end of the day, if you don't feel confident about getting into an NFT project, or if you don't like *x* or *y*, then simply don't get involved. Unless someone is coercing you and holding a gun to your head, if you lose out on a project, it is, as much as I *hate* to say it...*your fault.*\n\nIf you can accept and understand Rule 1, you then qualify for the remaining procedures and tips in this guide. So, are you ready? Here we go!\n\n## The MSQ NFT Survival Guide\n\nRight, so, you don't have to necessarily follow these checks and procedures in order, but this is more or less how I carry out a preliminary check on a project. Here goes:\n\n### Step 1: Check out the Project's Twitter Page\n\nThe reason I think it's best to start here is because so much discourse around NFT projects happens on Twitter. It's kinda the first port of call since you can see what a project is about, its social media links, how long it's been around for and what the community is saying. Now, before I begin here, I want to provide you with this...\n\n*Disclaimer: The sentiments expressed here do not necessarily reflect the opinions or attitudes of MSQ.io as a whole. Moreover, the following example's legitimacy is questionable, but it is not a proven scam per se. You are free to disagree with this appraisal, but based on existing evidence and sentiments around this project, I have reason to believe it is extremely risky to get involved in and is not something I would ever actively promote in any way, shape or form.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/l7qVx2y.png)\n\nNow this project, [GunHunter](https://twitter.com/GunHunterNFT), looks above board since it has links to its website as well as other social media sites. The page has been around since March 2021, and the project has well over 46K Followers. All good, right? Well, let's take a look at GunHunter's most recent post...\n\n![](twitter:GunHunterNFT/status/1457041291284402177)\n\nThis doesn't seem right to me. Over 46,000 Followers, but on this post, less than 20 Likes and a handful of Retweets? Now compare this with their Pinned Tweet:\n\n![](twitter:GunHunterNFT/status/1455036806756384773)\n\nSo just 5 days earlier, and this post has nearly 5,000 Likes and thousands of Quote Tweets and Retweets. Now just look at some of the comments:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gVkczqv.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WIy2IBf.png)\n\nAnd on and on it goes: hundreds and hundreds of generic bot comments repeated *ad infinitum*. Color me crazy, but this kind of thing doesn't instill much confidence in me. Does this prove it's a scam or rug pull? No. But consider that I also couldn't find anyone saying anything *negative* about the project either, which is also not a good sign. Unanimous praise for something with this many followers? Not buying it. Also, it doesn't look like anybody I know is aware of this project, nor have I even heard anyone in my rather extensive and growing circle talk about it. To me, this is a major red flag.\n\n### Step 2: Visit the Project's Website (If Applicable)\n\nWhile I would say don't trust a project if it doesn't have a website, that would be unfair because many great smaller projects don't necessarily have a full functioning website as-yet. That said, if there is a website, scope it out in its entirety. With GunHunter, the [website](https://www.gunhunternft.us/#) looks pretty decent: it has a full Roadmap, Tokenomics, even some examples of character designs and stats. However, this is what makes alarm bells go off in my head:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fJJ9NJ5.png)\n\nNow I have nothing against an anon team. In fact, it's very normal in any NFT project. However, the team's avatars all look like they came out of a weirdo Pixar movie or something. More than that, not a single social media link or anything of the sort. And why the ultra-cringe aliases? This is the only project I've seen like this, and I just can't get behind it. Oh, and check out their partners:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WZwovxd.png)\n\nPretty extensive list of very impressive partners and ecosystems, all in non-clickable low-res images. So this project is based on Binance Smart Chain, but is also going to have players on Polygon, Polkadot and Solana? That's pretty ambitious. It sounds...unlikely to me. Again, not buying it.\n\nTo be fair, according to their Roadmap, it looks like they are only in 'Pharse 1' (Farce 1!? Really?) of the project, so everything is still is ostensibly in early development. Maybe I'm jumping the gun here and I'm judging this project too harshly, but I dunno...personally, it's not compelling to me.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UxGRYdD.png)\n\n> Aptly named? Or am I crazy?\n\n### Step 3: Join the Project's Discord\n\nRight, so I joined the GunHunter Discord to scope out the community's activity there. This is what their *#general* channel primarily consists of:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KD9fKhu.png)\n\nA single admin occasionally responds to messages, or at least, one admin profile, but that's it. Additionally, there are 9,000 Discord members, but when I logged in initially, there were only 83 members online, which is incredibly low. However, there are numerous announcements and some engagement here, so I suppose that's one positive aspect:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/C3XZUwS.png)\n\nPrevious announcements range between 6 reactions and 2,000+. Seems like a major disparity to me, but maybe I'm just dreaming here. Thing is...where is the substance? I just don't feel it. I don't want to be part of this community. I don't even want to ask anything because it feels so alien and inconsistent. Major red flags here too.\n\n### Step 4: Look the Project Up on YouTube\n\nOK, so GunHunter does have a YouTube page with close to 1,900 subscribers and a single video. Here it is:\n\n![](youtube:d4lyj3jYG4o)\n\nSo there's a 32 second video with some music, a bunch of static images, some terrible 3D animated graphics and *zero* actual gameplay. Oh, the video also has 975 Likes and 1 Dislike (99.9% Likes). NOT BUYING IT! The Like to Dislike ratio is totally off, and the video is poorly edited even by an amateur YouTuber's standards. With a huge team of apparent experts (not that anyone could tell), you would expect the quality of final video to be substantially better. Something's off here. Yet again, red flags for days!\n\n## Step 5: Look at Any Other Info and/or Social Media Pages\n\nGunHunter has a [Telegram](https://t.me/GunHunterChannel) channel with nearly 60,000 members. So much hype right? I didn't bother joining because I suspect I'll get much the same results. Also, the icon I clicked on to get here was an Instagram icon, yet it took me to their Telegram? Huh?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/E7sDNpt.png)\n\nGunHunter is also on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GunHunter-NFT-102296442234796) with almost 10,000 followers. I clicked on a post...tons and tons of bot/generic comments. Need I say more?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zsIAQRe.png)\n\nI'm not going to go on with this because, to my mind, this isn't a project worth participating in. Again, you're free to disagree, and maybe I'm wrong, but where are the human beings here!?\n\n## Step 6: Make Your Decision\n\nIs GunHunter a scam or rug pull? Well, even if it isn't, I don't like it. Even if it is just a poorly put together and run project, I won't be getting involved. If you can find any evidence to the contrary or know something I don't, please contact me and enlighten me. I will be eternally grateful for the feedback!\n\n## The End of the Journey?\n\nWhile the above is useful, I feel like this is just a basic guide and doesn't really cover every type of scam. For this reason I and/or the rest of the team will have to do a follow-up article in the near future. Some other quick tips to help you out:\n\n- If it's too good to be true, it probably is\n- Don't just click on any link you receive unless you are 100% sure it is legitimate (be super careful in Discord in particular)\n- If you're unsure, ask\n- If you're unsure, wait\n- If you're really really unsure, don't get involved\n- Don't give in to peer pressure or groupthink/hype and make your own decisions\n- Own your mistakes and realize you may not get it right every time (you probably won't. I say this with love)\n\nI hope all of the above is of use to you. Again, if you have any feedback or information for me regarding GunHunter or any other comments, I welcome it with open arms. I am always happy to learn, and if I really am off-base, please feel free to tell me why. Until next time NFT fans, take care and look after yourselves!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GSt27q8.gif)",

      "slug": "building-a-village-welcoming-lamb-duhs",
      "body": "If you remember one of our [first posts](https://MSQ.io/blog/exploring-the-goals-of-the-nfty-village-gaming-metaverse) about NFTY Village, we went over all of our main goals relating to the NFTY Village Metaverse. One of those goals was No Competitors, Just Future Partners. So let's talk about how we are going to welcome our friends from other projects into NFTY Village.\n\n## A Village for Everyone\n\nOne of the mottos we float around our community is that \"it takes a village.\" To us it means that strong communities grow from positive environments where everyone tries to help one another and work together towards common goals.\n\nBlockchain and the NFT space in general suffers from a lot of tribalism. People have their favorite projects and stick to them, sometimes at the cost of alienating people from other communities. We want our project to focus on bringing people together and not building walls between them. That is why NFTY Village won't just consist of Alpacas or NFTs that we personally created. We are reaching out to great projects, with original art, that we can incorporate into the NFTY Village Metaverse.\n\n## Celebrating All Types of Villagers\n\nWhen it comes to bringing other projects into NFTY Village, we look for a few things:\n\n* Great art\n* Strong community\n* Hardworking teams\n\nDespite superficial metrics such as volume and floor price, we believe that projects that possess the above three criteria will succeed in the long-term.\n\nIncluding great projects within our game provides more utility for NFTs while introducing different projects to a wider and brand new audience. With that being said, one of the first NFTs outside of our collection that we will be incorporating into NFTY Village are the Lamb Duhs!\n\n## We like the Lambs\n\nIf you haven't heard about Lamb Duhs before, you should definitely take a look. Our parent company, MSQ, recently put together a [featured piece](https://MSQ.io/blog/little-bo-peeps-nft-sheep-lamb-duhs) on their collection and their ambitious plans for the future.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/u3UHxle.jpg)\n\nLamb Duhs is a collection of 8,500 cute digital lambs that wander the pastures of the Ethereum blockchain. From their amazing art to their impressive roadmap, the team at Lamb Duhs is constantly working and delivering for their community.\n\nIt was a natural and easy choice to include Lamb Duhs in NFTY Village. The only question that remains however is: Which Lamb Duh will take the journey to NFTY Village?\n\n## Looking for our Lamb Duh\n\nLamb Duhs is the first project we have chosen to include within NFTY Village. With over 8,500 different lambs, how will we ever choose our new resident NPC? Thankfully we have some ideas...\n\nThe team at NFTY Village will select 4 Lamb Duhs from Opensea. \n\nFrom there, we will hold a contest where the community can vote for their favorite lamb! The winning Lamb Duh will be featured within NFTY Village and we will have some fun giveaways planned for the remaining lambs!\n\nJoin us for our first round of voting this Friday, November 12th! We will be announcing the voting on twitter - [@nftyvillage](https://twitter.com/nftyvillage) \n\nWe aren't sheepish about taking these big steps, and we cannot wait to continue making more friends and giving them a home in NFTY Village.\n\n\n---\nMake sure to stay involved in our respective communities so you can join in on the fun! \n\nThe Duhverse (Lamb Duhs)\nTwitter: [@DuhverseNFT](https://twitter.com/duhversenft)\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/duhverse\n\nNFTY Village\nTwitter: [@nftyvillage](https://twitter.com/nftyvillage) \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/nftyvillage",

From Monday to Friday MSQ brings you all our top picks from from the vast realm of crypto—whether it's NFTs, DeFi protocols or Blockchain-based games, we always do our best to bring you the best projects on offer. In today's edition we're dusting off our Lynyrd Skynyrd vinyls and turning up the volume for...Tools of Rock!***\n\n## For Those About to Rock...\n\nI was never really hugely into music as a kid. In fact, I only really started to discover my propensity for the sonic early on in High School. One of my friends actually suggested I get a guitar and start learning at the beginning of ninth Grade. I casually mentioned it to my dad in passing one day, and he practically leaped at the opportunity. A few months before my 15th birthday, I got an acoustic guitar, but it wasn't until I got my first electric guitar on my 15th birthday that it really hit me—if there was ever a moment in my life where time stood still and Destiny called my name...it was right there and then.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/w38KB7U.gif)\n\n> For real, it was exactly like this\n\n19 years later, and I'm still at it, having recorded numerous songs across a range of projects and released the debut album of my latest project, [Imperious Vision](https://imperiousvision.bandcamp.com/album/empire-of-illusion), just over a year ago. I'm not sure what it is, but something about Rock and Metal has always stuck with me, and I've had a burning desire since that amazing moment on my 15th birthday to create and perform whenever I can. \n\nThat's why today's Discovery of the Day really strikes a chord with me (yup, I went there). [Tools of Rock](https://www.toolsofrock.com/) is an ultra sweet NFT collection consisting of 8,500 unique and generative NFTs rocking across the stages of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain. Each Tool of Rock is entirely unique and programmatically generated from over 170 possible traits including Pick Design, Pick Shape, Album Artwork, Vinyl, Frame, Background, Date, Rock History, and Vinyl Label. Although every Tool of Rock NFT is unique and is in and of itself a work of art and piece of Rock history, some are rare than others!\n\n### VIP Passes\n\nA cool feature of Tools of Rock is the VIP Pass that grants holders several benefits including being able to mint their Vol.1 (as well as future Volumes) album covers as unique NFTs, discounts on future mints and DAO access. Check out all the benefits below:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mA7LAOC.png)\n\n### Tools of Rock\n\nSo of course you love all the acts, but what about the headline act? Well say no more! Let's take a look at a few sample of the Tools of Rock:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Fw0NOTM.jpg)\n\n> This one makes me feel like [Runnin' with the Devil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5txwFv-zYM)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ibHdzoZ.jpg)\n\n> [Born in the USA!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPhWR4d3FJQ)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/trs6hSM.jpg)\n\n> [Purple Haze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJunCsrhJjg) anyone?\n\n### Collector Series Vol. 1\n\nAs an added bonus for avid fans and collectors, those Tools of Rock holders who collect 10 unique Tools of Rock that match certain prescribed criteria will receive an exclusive Tool of Rock (TOR), the *Stairway Collection Reward.* You can see more details below, or you can view it directly on the Tools of Rock [official website](https://www.toolsofrock.com/)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/g4D56jL.jpg)\n\n## Roadiemap\n\nOK, truth be told, Tools of Rock has a LOT going on. They've already hit a few milestones, so we've created an abridged version of their 'Roadiemap' for you to scope out:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3Gh3bjy.png)\n\nIf you want to view the full Roadiemap with all its details in its original full high-res glory, just click [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/876138941944844328/895137226726453278/image0.jpg)\n\n## Gods of Rock 🎸\n\nPresented by Tools of Rock, [Gods of Rock](https://mint.godsofrocknft.com/) is a Generative NFT project consisting of 10,000 Rockstars assembled from over 180 male traits and more than 90 female traits. From what it seems, you can still mint your own Rockstar directly via the Tools of Rock website, or you can pick up an existing Rocker over on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/godsofrock)\n\nHere's an example of what a Gods of Rock NFT looks like:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Esu9dIW.jpg)\n\n> I think this guy may be a fan of [The Misfits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misfits_(band))\n\n## Shredding Stats\n\nTools of Rock is completely sold out. However, you can still grab an NFT over on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/toolsofrock) if the itch is just something you have to itch!

      "body": "***The ARK Community is home to an assortment of characters from across the Blockchain space. Many of them are actively involved in a number of different activities and doing their part to help expand the ecosystem with their innovative ideas and ventures. A few weeks ago Friends of Little Yus, a Blockchain game powered by ARK tech, released on Steam. I had the privilege of sitting down with emsy, one of its creators, and talking about the project as well as his history with ARK. Check it out!***\n\n*The following interview was conducted remotely a few days after the launch of [Friends of Little Yus](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1752430/FriendsoflittleYus/). All information was supplied by emsy and is considered to be accurate at time of writing. However, be sure to follow Friends of Little Yus via their social media pages and website for all the latest updates and information.*\n\n## A Chat with emsy\n\n***OK, let's kick this off with a little bit of history. Tell me about yourself, your Delegate and how you got started on this journey...***\n\n> Hi, my name is emsy and I’m a software developer from the Netherlands. My ARK journey started in 2017 when I got to know ARK during the famous crypto boom. ARK’s concept of creating standalone and interoperable bridgechains is what really got me. I wanted to learn, so I started reading and joined the awesome ARK community. After a while I felt ready to start developing tools, and thanks to the ARK Community Fund, I was able to create a tool called [Arkifier](https://arkifier.net/). This tool e-mails you whenever your delegate loses its forging position.\n> \n> Completing my first ARK project felt great, and I quickly wanted to dive deeper, so I came up with second project called ArkPromo, which is a loyalty program utilizing its own bridgechain. Yes, you guessed it, after completing this project I still felt like doing more and applied for the [ARK Scooters](https://ark.io/blog/ark-scooters-a-rental-solution-using-iot-on-the-blockchain-f74c56060557) project. This is where I met PJ and a great collaboration was born. ARK Scooters is a scooter rental application using custom transactions where customers can interact with a scooter using a mobile app. All data is stored on a bridgechain using custom transactions built with ARK GTI (Generic Transaction Interface). This project took us more than a year to develop, and once completed, we decided to start a delegate called friendsoflittleyus.\n>\n> Our goal is to develop cool products using ARK tech to grow the project a whole. As of today we have completed multiple projects like an e-commerce webshop with real-time crypto payments, deployed a bridgechain for rapid prototyping called [Radians](https://radians.nl/) and launched a game on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) that runs on ARK tech. Developing ARK related projects is what we love and keep doing thanks to our beloved voters!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/suT8rOY.png)\n\n***Now I'm curious—why Friends of Little Yus? What's the story there?***\n\n> Great question! That’s actually something many people probably don't know. ARK’s currency sign (Ѧ) is actually a letter of the Cyrillic script called 'Little Yus.' Because of our history with ARK, we feel like friends, so we decided to go with the name 'Friends of Little Yus.'\n\n***Could you tell me more about the mechanics of the game? I tried out the first level and it reminds me a lot of rage games like [Getting Over It with Bennet Foddy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/240720/GettingOverItwithBennettFoddy/)—why is it so challenging?***\n\n> It just puts a big smile on my face every time someone tells me that the game is hard, knowing that there’s a good chance he or she has raged playing the game... I think I might be evil, I don’t know…\n>\n> In all seriousness, we designed the game to be challenging. We really want to make sure that players feel accomplished when they finally reach the flag. We have plans to add a Play-to-Earn (P2E) mechanic so players can really compete for the prizes. Practice makes perfect!\n>\n> ARK tech serves as the backbone of the game. Data such as characters, names, login/logout states and scores are all stored on our bridgechain called Radians. Accounts are required in order to play, and we use Radians wallets for that. Players can easily register accounts from within the game.\n>\n> You can check out the Radians explorer to view game related transactions yourself at https://explorer.radians.nl\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b3jcwt0.png)\n\n***So is this Play-to-Earn? Do players simply receive a payout when they complete a level? If so, what currency do you use?***\n\n> The current playable version of the game is not Play-to-Earn. However, we are currently working on such feature at this point in time. We are slowly adding more maps to create more diversity, and once we feel like we have enough maps, we plan to add a mechanic rewarding the fastest players with ARK coins. Every week the leaderboard will reset and a random map will be selected, creating a new chance for everyone to be the fastest and win. All of this will be fully automated. We think that Play-to-Earn will keep the game very much alive and attract more players, thus creating more recognition and wider participation in the long-run.\n\n***What games inspired you to create a side-scroller? I assume you guys are fans of the format?***\n\n> I’ve played a lot of side-scrollers in the past like [Super Mario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario) and [MapleStory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapleStory) to name a few. I like pixel art and the simplicity of 2D side-scroller games. And oh, from a developer point of view, 2D games are way easier to develop than 3D games! Haha!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/85UmEqg.jpg)\n\n***How about platforms? I know that the game works on PC but are there plans for console players to participate as well?***\n\n> At this point in time the game works on MacOS and Windows. We currently have no plans for adding console builds as the game engine does not officially support these export platforms yet. On the other hand, we do have plans for adding support for iOS and Android devices. We believe that this will open the door for many new users and grow the project substantially as a result.\n\n***How has the community received the game so far? How has the overall feedback been?***\n\n> The release of the game has turned out great! We have received a lot of positive messages and feedback. We take the community to heart and listen to their feedback very seriously. We’ve already deployed several bug fixes and changes thanks to them. All the support is really appreciated!\n>\n> Now for some numbers. These are the actual stats of the game as of today (since launch):\n> \n> * More than 6,000 unique Steam users have added the game to their library\n> * The have been over 17,000 page visits on Steam\n> * There are more than 600 unique characters registered on the Blockchain\n> * Over 3,500 game related transactions are now stored on the Blockchain\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/y8xgO1U.jpg)\n\n***What's the future looking like for Friends of Little Yus? Is this going to be a full-blown game? When can we expect it?***\n\n> The current version of the game is a great foundation to build upon. We plan to keep on integrating features like a Play-to-Earn mechanic as well as more maps and obstacles. One of the biggest features will be adding multiplayer support, a huge undertaking to say the least. Once this feature is fully implemented, we expect the game to be complete and ready to move on from its alpha/early access stage. In the meantime, we will continuously deploy updates in order to ensure the project remains active.\n\n***Do you have anything else in the works that you care to share? Another game or project perhaps?***\n\n> Much of our delegate work in the past has been creating proof of concepts to demonstrate ARK's technology and provide examples to inspire new developers. Building on ARK's concept of being 'The Simplest Way to Blockchain,' we are working on modules for a low-code prototyping platform called [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) that will enable someone with minimal coding experience to quickly create a simple app interacting with the ARK blockchain and other bridgechains.\n>\n> We believe that by running a delegate on the APN network, it is also our job to support and promote the entire ARK Ecosystem of bridgechains. In the past we have done this by making our custom plugins and utilities function on various other bridgechains. Going forward we will continue to do this along with prototyping some interesting cross-chain applications.\n\n***Is there anything you would you like to say to the ARK Community and the cryptosphere as a whole?***\n\n> For sure! I guess all I can really say is... you guys are awesome! We would like to give special thanks to our voters for supporting us since they make all our work possible. We share less than the average delegate, allowing us to spend more time working on our projects. Our goal is to grow ARK as a whole by utilizing their software because we think this is what it’s all about. Thanks again, all of this allows us to do what we love! And thanks to the ARK team for interviewing us!\n\nI'd like to thank emsy for taking his time to talk about Friends of Little Yus and sharing his thoughts and opinions with us. I'd also like to thank PJ, emsy's partner in Friends of Little Yus, for his contributions as well. Be sure to check out Friends of Little Yus on their [website](https://friendsoflittleyus.nl/), and don't forget to follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FriendsYus). You can also join the ARK [Discord](https://discord.gg/arkecosystem) and chat to emsy and PJ directly there. Now what are you waiting for? Download **Friends of Little Yus** and get grinding, it's free to play!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rirmFNV.png)",

However, much of the country's past is blood-soaked and characterized by significant amounts of human suffering.

Eight years later, under immense pressure, Yeltsin resigned and chose [Vladimir Putin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin) as his successor. Putin served as President of Russia from 1999 to 2008 and reclaimed the position in 2012. In 2021, he still holds power. Putin has been criticized for silencing and imprisoning opponents, mismanaging the COVID-19 pandemic, vehemently opposing same-sex marriage and dismantling the rights of members of the LGBTQ+ community. As a result, many have come to see the Russian strongman as a tyrant hellbent on maintaining control and crushing dissident voices by any means necessary.\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JbLi6L6.jpg)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\nVladimir Putin, current President of the Russian Federation\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n## Straight Outta Russia\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/31pzb39/Pussy-Riot-by-Igor-Mukhin.jpg)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n<i>Pussy Riot circa 2012 (Photo credit: [Igor Mukhin](https://twitter.com/igormoukhin))</i>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nFebruary 21st, 2012—Five women swaddled in long winter overcoats determinedly made their way into the [Cathedral of Christ the Saviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_Christ_the_Saviour) and ascended the pulpit. Situated along the Moscow River and just hundreds of meters from the Kremlin, this site is long considered the seat of the Russian Orthodoxy. Somewhat befitting this momentous event was the debut of [Tchaikovsky's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky) *1812 Overture* some 130 years earlier.\n\nCoats tossed aside revealing colorful clothing and donning their signature—and potentially [cat pee stained](https://youtu.be/7xd0WlrSEik?t=2m40s)—balaclavas, [Pussy Riot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pussy_Riot) set in motion a chain of events that would lead to their imprisonment and cement them as champions of free speech.\n\nWhile dancing and singing 'Mother Mary, drive Putin away,' the five were promptly bum-rushed and escorted from the pulpit. Their 'Punk Prayer' was viewed by many as a direct attack on the Orthodox Church. [Reportedly](https://www.levada.ru/sites/default/files/2012_eng.pdf), only about 19% of Russians saw this performance as a protest against Pres. [Vladimir Putin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin) at the time.\n\nThree of the five were ultimately arrested and charged with 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred,' denied bail, and held for more than four months without a court hearing. They were subsequently sentenced to two years imprisonment in a women's labor camp.\n\n![](youtube:PN5inCayfnM)\n\nSince their release at the end of 2013, *Pussy Riot* has toured around the world and performed at major festivals including Glastonbury, Roskilde, Sziget, Riot Fest, Rock al Parque, Banksy's Dismaland, Nova Rock, and Festival of Dangerous Ideas at [The Sydney Opera House](https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/).

From Monday to Friday we bring you our Discovery of the Day featuring some of our top picks for NFTs, DeFi protocols and Blockchain Games. In today's edition we're taking a trip to the digital Candy Store and tipping our hat to Hansel and Gretel. Welcome and bienvenue to: Bubblegum Kids!***\n\n## Chewy Delicious Fun!\n\nSpearmint, Cherry, Blueberry...who doesn't like a fresh stick of Bubble Gum? But let's be real—what do any of us really know about this sticky candy store staple's history? Well, this sweet stretchy treat adored by many was first created all the way back in 1928 by an accountant for the Fleer Chewing Gum Company, [Walter Deimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Diemer). Now my man Walter was way ahead of his time—I guess you could say he was the Satoshi Nakamoto of the world of candied treats. So before creating Bubble Gum, he committed his time towards marketing a new kind of gum, 'Dubble Bubble,' where he taught salesmen how to blow bubbles as a selling point for the gum. Genius, right!?\n\nSo Walter here decided to give numbers and marketing a break so that he could experiment with some new gum recipes. Little did he know that he would soon become the inventor of Bubble Gum! While experimenting, Walter created a recipe based on a formula for a chewing gum called 'Blibber Blubber,' which was found to be less sticky than regular chewing gum and way easier to stretch. An so Bubble Gum was born! Today this universally enjoyed delight comes in a range of flavors and can be found in just about every country you can think of!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UbUeI7L.gif)\n\n> *Fun Fact: Bubble Gum was originally a dingy gray color. Eventually red dye was added to the recipe, thus imbuing it with its signature pink hue!*\n\n## New Bubblegum Kids on the Block\n\n*Gum morning*, *gumjour* and *gumgiorno* MSQ friends! What's popping? I hope you don't feel too hungry after that introduction! Today I'm excited to present a new project that's recently entered the NFT space, [Bubblegum Kids](https://bubblegumkids.xyz/home). These Kids are part of a collection of 10,000 randomly generated NFTs on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain. Each Bubblegum Kid is created from a variety of traits including outfits, bubblegum color, eyes, accessories, headgear and so on. The project's core team is full of passionate, hard-working people in the NFT space, and the delightfully sweet art was created by the one and only [KingODawg](https://twitter.com/Kingodawg_).\n\nNow that you know the basics, let's take a peak at some of these fantastic NFTS:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gBWv4qx.png)\n\n> That Bubble Gum's gonna get burnt if a dragon is chewing it...maybe that's why it's brown?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pOAoEAK.png)\n\n> Some say his glasses broke from the sheer force of the Bubble Gum popping too explosively\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/F2qoJGp.png)\n\n> *I believe, whatever doesn't kill you, simply makes you...[stranger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhfSQ7WaOa0)!*\n\n### Bubblegum Puppies\n\nBelieve it or not, news on these literally dropped a few hours before this article was due to be published! Aren't they absolutely adorable!? Bubblegum Puppies will be airdropped to all Bubblegum Kids holders in the not-too-distant future. Don't you love it when you get rewards for loyalty and participation? However, before the airdrop takes place, some further steps need to be taken first, and according to what I've seen and heard, the establishment of Bubblegum Labs needs to occur before the airdrop happens. I have a feeling it's not too far away though. Exciting stuff!\n\n![](twitter:bubblegumkids_/status/1458567541555597317)\n\n## The Road to Bubblegum Land\n\nI have to say that, when I first saw the Roadmap for Bubblegum Kids, I was excited before I even started reading it! I mean, just look at it...so colorful and vibrant! Haha, I'm already sold!\n\nSo if you take a closer look, the Roadmap includes several items and milestones including merchandise, a comic book, a community wallet and even the creation of a Bubblegum Kids Metaverse! Supremely sweet! You can view the full technicolor Roadmap below 👇 or you can view it directly on Bubblegum Kids' [website](https://bubblegumkids.xyz/roadmap)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xVdCOda.jpg)\n\n> It's so enticing it almost looks edible!\n\nOver on The Bubblegum Kids' [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bubblegumkids_), you'll see they've been posting teasers and sneak peeks of their upcoming exclusive merchandise. Now that's neat!\n\n![](twitter:bubblegumkids_/status/1456357800817401861?s=20)\n\nIn the future, there are plans to create a Governance Token so that, as Bubblegum Kids grows, these tokens can be developed and dropped to holders who then decide on the future of the project via voting and similar methods. In this way, the community will have a greater say in how the project develops over time.\n\n## Bouncy Bubbly Stats\n\nThe Bubblegum Kids collection is sold out, but you can still grab yourself one (or two, or three) of these Bubblegum-chewing cuties over on the project's [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/bubblegumkids) page. Now let's take a look at some cursory stats...\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\n\n* **Total Items** - 10K\n* **Owners** - 3.5K\n\nBubblegum Kids is a super cute NFT project that you should pay close attention to.

      "body": "***Player created digital economies boomed when loot-based games gained mainstream popularity in the early 2000s. At the center of every loot-based system is a strictly controlled in-game economy. Despite all efforts to keep these economies in-game, black markets using real world money to buy and sell items or in-game currencies continued to pop up. This gave gamers around the world their first taste of what would form the basis of a system most Blockchain games use called Play-to-Earn (P2E). Learning about these black markets led me to one of the craziest gaming stories I have ever encountered. So strap in for launch! Let's look at a personal history of digital game economies and The Guiding Hand Social Club in EVE Online***\n\n## Grind. Loot. Sell. Repeat\n\nLet's go way back to ancient times when I was young. The summer of 2000 was just like any Michigan summer before that. Except, instead of hours spent in the woods and at the park with friends, this summer was different. This was the year my favorite game of all time was released, [Diablo 2](https://diablo2.blizzard.com/). Instead of building forts in the woods, I grinded *Diablo.* Instead of hanging out with friends, I grinded *Diablo*.\n\nDespite my parents not seeing it this way, my self-induced isolation in the computer room wasn't spent alone. I was still spending time with my friends since most of them had also purchased the game. It was also the summer I got my first taste of what would eventually become the core of Non-Fungible Token (NFT)-based Blockchain games currently exploding in popularity using a mechanic called Play-to-Earn (P2E)—player-driven economies.\n\n*Diablo 2* improved on everything contained within the original [Diablo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_(video_game)), so naturally, I was hooked. In fact, not just hooked—addicted. I would stay up as long as possible and sneak back downstairs to keep playing any chance I could. At the time I considered myself a master of stealth and silence, something I'm sure my parents would strongly disagree with. Needless to say, I was caught out regularly. But, during one of these sessions, I heard about an item called *The Stone of Jordan*.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0V3MFe0.jpg)\n\n> The original motivation to grind (or buy)...for me, at least\n\nI needed this item. I'm not entirely sure why since there were far better items for my Amazon, but the fact remained. I tried to trade for it using the in-game marketplace, but to no avail. However, I did find something *else*—a link to a black market website that would let me get this precious ring I so desperately needed. The only issue was...I needed a credit card.\n\nSo, being the honorable and not-degenerate youth I was, I put my head towards the goal and grinded until I found my very own *Stone of Jordan.* Well, if I'm being honest, I promptly and without hesitation grabbed my mom's credit card and bought the item. This is a decision I would later regret since my mom eventually found out, but that didn't matter. I had my item! *Or did I*?\n\nAt the time there was essentially a trust system for these purchases. After the transaction was made on a website, a player would meet you in an agreed upon private game name and give you the item via the trade mechanic—a risky system that Blockchain smart contracts addressed beautifully. And even though I didn't have the power of Blockchain at the time, I experienced no issues and received my item. I didn't earn this item. I didn't struggle to find it. I just *wanted* it. So I just bought it. Did that bug me? Absolutely not! I had a *Stone of Jordan* baby!\n\n## I Did It, and I'd Do It Again!\n\nAfter I acquired my sweet, sweet ring, I was hooked on the black market. A few weeks later during another grind session, a realization burst into my mind—I myself could be the one selling these items for money! I set up a PayPal account and registered on a number of black market websites, and onward I went into the world of digital asset ownership within games. The first item I ever sold was a bow called 'Windforce.' It was rare, I had it, and I succeeded in selling it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QQ9QUrh.jpg)\n\n> It really is one of the greatest items in the game!\n\nAround the time of my first sale I remember logging into *Battle.net* and entering the trade chat. I subsequently received an official message from *Diablo 2*. It issued a severe warning to anyone caught buying or selling items off network and promised that they would receive the ultimate punishment for their transgressions—the *Perma-Ban*.\n\nEven after the warning, I participated in, fueled, and fully supported these digital black markets as often as I could. I spent years selling items, making money and ignoring the warnings like many other players during this time. I even came across someone on Reddit that claimed to have earned around $5,000 USD over 3 months and decided to make it his full-time job. From my own experience, this is something I can actually say was possible at the time.\n\nSo, as the community continued to ignore the rules and sold assets, a war raged on in the background. Stories of well-known players being banned began to surface. Chat rooms started filling up with whispers that a friend was banned for buying or selling items. These whispers soon started to grow louder and louder until...\n\n*Nothing.* Yup, nothing happened. Anti-climactic? Agreed. OK, technically notorious accounts have actually been banned or removed as well as *some* players, but generally speaking, regular players have never, (and will never) run into this issue. But, while game developers pretended to combat the issue and advised players not to participate in these black markets, a game came out that not only allowed, but embraced, utilized and encouraged player-based economies. This game is set in a universe of space domination, piracy, resources, and treaties. That's right, I'm talking about [EVE Online](https://www.eveonline.com/) .\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FGOtoDP.jpg)\n\n> EVE Online is still going strong to this day, but it's even more punishing for new players than ever before...at least that's what I was told\n\n## A Brave New World\n\nNow I'm not saying *Diablo* or *EVE Online* were the first games to actually permit these things, but they were definitely part of the titans involved in the adoption of digital player economies in games. Personally I have never played *EVE Online*. That said, I still knew *EVE* had played a huge part in the acceptance of these systems. So I set out to learn more about *EVE's* unique economy for my own enlightenment.\n\nIn all honesty, *EVE* was light-years ahead of its time. *EVE* uses a currency called Interstellar Kredits (ISK) combined with a system of *Sinks* and *Faucets*. *Sinks* serve as a way to flow money out of the game while *Faucets* bring money into it. Players were not punished or threatened with bans if they converted items into real world money—instead they were told it was *essential* for the system that they did so...\n\nIf this sounds familiar to Blockchain games, well, that's because it is. *EVE* took this economy very seriously using an intricate system to regulate scarcity within the game. They even went as far as hiring actual economists to help control the fluctuating liquidity pools of in-game resources that change in relation to player population sizes. While reading up on these systems, I stumbled across an insane story of spies, kill contracts, Empires toppled and, at the center of it all, assets worth actual real world currency.\n\nBefore I get into this story, there are a few key aspects to understand about *EVE Online* first. In the game, if a player's ship is destroyed, they have an escape pod that is only vulnerable for a short period of time. If that pod is destroyed, that player loses *everything.* With this level of risk, teams of people band together and form what are called *Corporations*. Similar to traditional guilds or clans, these Corporations allow players the benefit of achieving strength in numbers and thereby the ability to dominate resource gathering, piracy, or any other task(s) they choose to focus on.\n\n*Corporations* are run by some key figures, most notably CEOs, lieutenants, and trusted individuals put in-charge of hangars and coffers. Hangars and coffers are deposit spots that members can safely store ships and pool resources worth tens of thousands of USD in a few select cases. *EVE Online* currently has an estimated 600 Trillion ISK valued at around 18 Million USD. This is a lower figure when compared with amounts seen previously in the game's history, but nevertheless, it's still pretty impressive.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ONkVmhY.jpg)\n\n> The Molok, a ship with an estimated worth of 500 Billion ISK (around $4,000 USD at present)\n\n## A Not So Simple Contract\n\nNow let's set the stage: The year is 2004, *EVE Online* is in business, and business is booming. As always, a handful of large corporations dominate and maintain overall power in the game's universe. Anyone who has been part of a large clan in one or more MMOs knows that petty squabbles can quickly turn into distrust, burnt bridges and in-game wars. *EVE* was no different, boasting a large market and consistent demand for bounties or kill contracts on other players.\n\nThese contracts are not actually part of *EVE's* in-game mechanics; instead, they are agreements between players. And where there are contracts, there are people or groups ready to complete them. Perhaps the most infamous group is *The Guiding Hand Social Club* which gained notoriety after pulling off one of the most labor-intensive and insane heists ever in *EVE Online* and, in my opinion, the world of gaming as a whole.\n\n*The Guiding Hand* was approached by an unidentified player who had a simple contract: Kill the player *Mirial* and present their cold, dead body as proof. Easy, right? Not so much...\n\n*Mirial* was CEO of the giant *Ubiqua Seraph*, one of the most powerful *Corporations* of that time. The unidentified player agreed to pay the sum requested by *The Guiding Hand* and flat-out refused to take any percentage of the resources and salvage attained from the hit. This was something that was not usually denied when offered in these types of contracts. So, with payments agreed and made, the *Guiding Hand* devised a plan to accomplish this monumental task and got to work.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xiP53Ov.png)\n\n> *Ubiqua Seraph's* Insignia\n\n\n## The Art of Deception and Infiltration\n\nThe exact details are vague since members of the group seemingly maintained a high level of secrecy regarding how they did it, but the plan itself was simple enough: Gain the trust of their target and set a trap. While the plan may have been straightforward, the execution and time-intensive nature of it was anything but.\n\nI found reports that *The Guiding Hand* set up situations where their spies could help members of the *Ubiqua Seraph* Corporation to garner trust and be welcomed into the Corporation's ranks. An example is learning shipping times and routes to initiate fake ambushes so that the spies could appear just in time and save the transports. Another entailed paying the Corporation to assist their spies in minor tasks over and over again with no issues.\n\nEventually *The Guiding Hand's* patience and determination paid off. And what patience and determination it was! The operation took over *10 months* to complete! I'm assuming you may glossed over that fact. Yup, 10 months, nearly an entire year, to achieve an objective, inside a video game, to kill a *single* player. Nevertheless, *The Guiding Hand* had infiltrated not only the 2nd-in-command position under *Mirial* herself, but *every single* Corporation hangar and coffer, giving them access to thousands of dollars of in-game items anytime they wanted.\n\nDid I mention they had spies on the board of directors and within a Corporation-specific class called *Arenis Xemdal*? This division had the power to negate any high ranking official's decisions, including those of the CEO. With the chessboard prepped for checkmate, all that was left to do was wait for the perfect time to spring the trap...\n\n## *'Execute Order 66'*\n\nEarly in the morning of April 18th 2005, *Mirial* warped in only to find out what *The Guided Hand* was capable of. In a matter of minutes, *Mirial* would be assassinated, and every single hangar and coffer of the *Ubiqua Seraph* Corporation looted. All of this would transpire with the uttering of a single word—*Nichole*. Upon receiving this execution code, all spies within *The Guided Hand* would know it was finally time to pounce. The events that followed would graduate the word *Nichole* from a simple innocuous name to the rank of legend among *EVE Online* players.\n\nWith every hangar and coffer emptied, every office raided, and billions of ISK in losses even before the items themselves were included (as *Mirial* piloted and lost one of the most expensive ships in the entire game), *The Guided Hand* was able to steal resources, ships and assets worth a total of $16,000 USD. Now with current NFT prices, that may seem like a small sum, but to anyone truly considering the nature of the situation, it was an untold fortune.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ii2LS7Z.gif)\n\nThis is a loss that the *Ubiqua Seraph* Corporation would never recover from. The uttering of *Nichole* wiped them off the control board in less than an hour. *The Guided Hand Social Club* had achieved the impossible and changed the history of *EVE Online* forever.\n\nIn terms of the impact, imagine logging on knowing 1 of 5 groups controls the majority of events and assets in the game's universe, and the next day, that same group has been completely eliminated. This was where *The Guided Hand Social Club* demonstrated the power of their group's name: they guided their targets into the situations they wanted and handed each of them a piece of their puzzle through calculated manipulation and expert subterfuge.\n\nThe cherry on top here was that, after everything had happened, there were rumors the resource bounty had been offered up *again*, something that incurred no risk whatsoever, just a simple yes, and the contract holder would be remunerated. The holder allegedly denied this offer yet again...all they had wanted was *Mirial*'s virtual corpse.\n\nI can't say for sure that this rumor is true, but I found multiple posts that supported it. The real question is—What could someone have possibly done so heinously to someone else that they would outright deny a real world payout with nothing to lose? I mean, they received no reimbursement after the fact. All they had wanted was *Mirial* dead.\n\n## It Was the Future, But It's Here Now\n\nAs I wrestle with thoughts regarding what could have motivated someone to refuse such a handsome reward, I am inevitably reminded of the main point—someone wanted an in-game service and was able to have it fulfilled via a mechanism within a player-based economy.\n\nWe are at the beginning of what I hope to be the mass adoption of this type of economy necessary for Blockchain-based games using Play-to-Earn (P2E). And as I mentioned earlier about black markets in early digital economies, I will reiterate for Blockchain P2E: I participate in, fuel and fully support them any chance I get...",

      "body": "***Hey there! Welcome to another Discovery of the Day! MSQ covers pretty much everything related to Blockchain and crypto. From Monday to Friday you can catch some of our top picks in DeFi, NFTs, Blockchain Games and the Metaverse. We do our best to pick only legitimate projects with a proven track record and great fundamentals for you to check out. Now, we implore you to put on your spacesuits and enter the airlock as we bring you...Starl!***\n\n## Exploring Space in the Metaverse\n\nTo date, scientists have only explored about 4% of the visible universe. The record for the farthest distance traveled in space by humans is 400,171 kilometers (approximately 248,655 miles) from Earth. This was achieved by the all-American crew of the famous [Apollo 13.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13) Naturally this is impressive and all, but the question us NFT addicts should be asking is, *'How much of the Metaverse have we explored?'*\n\nUnfortunately we don't have exact statistics on that...not yet at least. But who knows where we'll be in five years' time? Now space-themed NFTs aren't all that unique. In fact, there are plenty of them, and given just how unbelievably cool space is, it's little wonder why. Of course, 'space' is a pretty broad term that covers a whole range of different phenomena, and for this reason, it's perfect fuel for the human imagination. Can I get enough of space-themed NFTs? The answer is simple: No, I absolutely cannot!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UqdiUZm.gif)\n\n> *In all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order* - Carl Jung\n\n[**Starl**](https://www.starltoken.com/) is something particularly unique. It is the first 100% community-owned decentralized virtual space project. There's even a governance token for the Starl Ecosystem, and yes, it's called $STARL. In Starl, you can buy, sell and trade virtual satellites, spacecraft and land all while exploring the vast expanse of the galaxy. The possibilities are endless! In addition, the Starl Metaverse is being designed as a fully-fledged interactive 3D universe based in space that gives players the freedom to explore different virtual worlds and communities.\n\nThere will be a range of different activities and missions Starl Metaverse users will be able to embark upon. As the Starl team themselves put it:\n\n> ***'The possibilities are only limited by imagination.'***\n\nIn the Starl Metaverse you will be able to:\n\n- Buy and sell virtual real estate\n- Purchase satellites and/or rent them out to others\n- Create, sell and buy NFTs\n- Customize your own avatar\n- Socialize and interact with real people\n- Explore, gamble, learn, play games\n- The list goes on and on!\n\nThe brilliant minds behind the Starl Metaverse are two well-respected people within the cryptosphere. They are none other than the illustrious [Woof Decentra](https://twitter.com/WoofDecentra) and [Moe Larson.](https://twitter.com/starlinkmoe) Of course, a project as ambitious as Starl requires a passionate team that is comprised of talented 3D artists and expert programmers. In short, Starl has an enormously capable team working tirelessly to ensure all of the project's lofty goals are accomplished in a professional and timely manner.\n\nNow that we've covered the fundamentals of Starl, let's take a brief glance at what you can expect to see within this vast and expanding Metaverse...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TTK91xV.gif)\n\n> Living Module #87 - **Celaeno**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Gu7wokG.gif)\n\n> LEO Satellite #29 - **GIGANTE**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aZt87Ur.gif)\n\n> Living Module #104 - **Hydra**\n\nThe three above examples are just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. The Marketplace is home to hundreds of Living Modules, Satellites and more. You  can visit it right now by clicking [here](https://market.starltoken.com/market)\n\n*Please Note: The Starl Marketplace is still in its Beta phase. Please bear this in mind before initiating any kind of transaction or making use of the services provided by the Marketplace.*\n\n## Building an *Actual* Space Station\n\nYes, the title isn't hyperbole. Starl is building an *actual* Space Station. How? Well, as Starl correctly points out, digital real estate has become a legitimate asset class. For this reason, it's rapidly becoming a major consideration for investors and is something that is almost certainly going to appreciate in a massive way over the coming months and years.\n\nAs a direct result of this shift, Starl tokens will serve as the investment tool for interested parties to purchase virtual land in Starl Station. This will, in turn, mimic a physical space station positioned in an actual corner of the galaxy. If that isn't the single coolest thing you've ever heard, then I don't know! I've heard of NFT and Blockchain projects doing some impressive things, but building an actual space station may just take the cake! With this in mind, here's a breakdown of the main components of the Starl Ecosystem:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CnKk9pM.png)\n\nIt's pretty clear that Starl is no ordinary project. In fact, it's suitably complex in terms of its overall structure. This said, with the right motivation and direction, and with the requisite support, there's very little impeding Starl from attaining its objectives.\n\n## A Map of Infinity\n\nThe Starl Metaverse Roadmap is nearly as vast as the cosmos itself! I simply cannot include all of the details in this article, so I'll break down the core elements for you as best I can:\n\nThe Roadmap is split up into 4 Missions that focus on developing a wide array of elements that make up the Starl Metaverse as a whole. These elements include the Marketplace, DAO, NFTs, Desktop & Mobile applications, Minigames, and so on. As it stands, Mission 1 has is complete and Mission 2 is currently in progress (and seemingly near completion).\n\nBeyond the 4 Missions, the Roadmap includes an [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) Metaverse Development Tasklist/Roadmap split up into 8 distinct phases—this is purely focused on developing and designing the 3D Metaverse. Some of the tasks involved in each phase include creating the Nexus Station, implementing Multiplayer (Co-op and PvP missions with increased rewards), player-owned stations and much, much more.\n\nLike I said, there's a *lot* going towards the development of Starl. You can take a closer look at their official Metaverse Roadmap by clicking [here](https://starl-docs.gitbook.io/starl-metaverse-documentation/details/metaverse-roadmap)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R5Gh5TR.jpg)\n\n> Oliver remembered his suit but forgot his factor 5,000 sunscreen...\n\n## Stellar Stats\n\nYou can get involved in the Starl project by visiting their [Marketplace](https://market.starltoken.com/market) (still in Beta at time of writing) and viewing the NFT modules available there. Once the Starl Metaverse is operational, and when you decide to join it, these NFTs will definitely be your ticket to securing your place among the stars.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ackmDnw.png)\n\n> Check out these [FAQs](https://www.starltoken.com/#faq) on Starl\n\nIn summary, Starl is a really impressive project that you should keep on your radar. Follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/StarLinkETH) and [Medium](https://starlmeta.medium.com/) so that you can catch all the latest updates from the team as they become available. If you're more on the technical side and want to read about the project in greater detail, you can check out Starl's whitepaper [here](https://www.starltoken.com/starlink-wp-2.pdf)\n\nAnd so we've reached the end my friends. In all honesty, Starl isn't just a game or an NFT collection—it's an entire ecosystem being developed by some incredible minds from across the Blockchain industry. We've covered Starl in a fair amount of detail, but there's a whole lot to explore here, so get to it!

If you haven't read our previous blog post 'Building a Village' where we discuss expanding the NFTY Village Metaverse by partnering up with other awesome NFT projects, you can do so here.***\n\n## Welcoming the Mini Monkey Mafia to NFTY Village\n\nToday at NFTY Village we are ecstatic to share with you the second project joining us at NFTY Village...**Mini Monkey Mafia!** \n\nThe Mini Monkey Mafia reside in the dense jungles of the Ethereum Blockchain, they are created from over 126 traits and accessories, with a population of 5,000. At NFTY Village we are pleased to welcome such a project that consists of a hard working team, strong community and of course these charming monkeys.\n\nTo learn more about them you can visit their [website](https://monkeymafia.co/) or check out MSQ's [featured piece](https://MSQ.io/blog/discovery-of-the-day-mini-monkey-mafia) on their collection and their ambitious plans for the future.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hD7GTEm.gif)\n\nPeople who adopted one of these loveable monkeys recently received an even smaller monkey. A Mini Monkey Mafia Baby. How much smaller will their next airdrop be!?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rcHiPMA.jpg)\n\n\n## Which Mini Monkey will appear in NFTY Village?\n\nMini Monkey Mafia is one of the first projects we have chosen to include within NFTY Village. Having 5,000 different monkeys within the collection it sounds nearly impossible to choose just one to be NFTY Village's new NPC! Not to worry, we have a plan.\n\nThe team at NFTY Village will select 4 Mini Monkeys from OpenSea.\n\nFrom there, we will hold a contest where the community can vote for their favorite monkey! The winning Mini Monkey will be featured within NFTY Village and we will have some fun giveaways planned for the remaining monkeys!\n\nJoin us for our first round of voting on Friday, November 19th at 12PM EDT! We will be announcing the voting on twitter - [@nftyvillage](https://twitter.com/MiniMonkeyMafia)\n\n---\n\nMake sure to stay involved in our respective communities so you can join in on the fun!\n\n**Mini Monkey Mafia**\n\nTwitter: [@MiniMonkeyMafia](https://twitter.com/minimonkeymafia)\n\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/YWmQBb3kf2\n\n**NFTY Village**\n\nTwitter: [@nftyvillage](https://twitter.com/nftyvillage)\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/nftyvillage",

      "body": "_**Did you miss us? We certainly missed you! It's time for another fantastic MSQ Discovery of the Day! Every day, from Monday to Friday, we put together a piece about our latest finds from across the cryptosphere...DeFi, NFTs, the Metaverse, Blockchain Gaming...we cover it all! In today's edition, MSQ's very own [Simon Downey](https://MSQ.io/users/simon) AKA sleepdeficit reports on an NFT project particularly close to his heart. Welcome to CryptoMories...**_\n\n## It's Okay to Step Away\n\nHyper-focused and behind schedule, I sat staring intently at the glowing monitor nested to the side of my darkly lit home office; I always do my best work when I can tune out the rest of the world. And working from home has its perks too. I choose my schedule, I can listen to music as loud as I want, snack while I work, no one telling me, *'ya got time to lean, ya got time to clean.'* I can just move at my own pace. That's the dream, ain't it?\n\nI also <s>live with</s> battle a condition some of you may be no stranger to: ADHD. It is an SOB. I constantly need to remind myself to stay on task; my thoughts can race wildly, jumping from one 'great' idea to the next; even the slightest distraction can throw me drastically off course where it can take an embarrassing amount of effort to get back on track. A lot of managing this beast comes down to setting myself up for success.\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/5LTqmBs/dark-room-computer.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\n[Jimmy Eat World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Eat_World) plays in the background—their newest release, [Futures: Phoenix Sessions](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ljoGq2qdJFP3-AtwJQnLEoOU0cyOlbPKY) (_[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/41W2Ns2xlYdvXG0aeVi3ig?si=By1EMdnjSciRpZUXuDOCYw)_), is my latest jam. Hammering away on the keyboard and switching determinedly between tabs and windows, I hear the door behind me. Light blindingly fills the room as my 5 year old daughter's silhouette appears. 'Oh, man. I have **got** to get this work done!' I think to myself in frustration. 'Dad...I miss my grandma.'\n\nMy heart sank.\n\nImmediately, my frustration dissipated. Aurora's grandmother had passed unexpectedly a year earlier from cancer; she was only in her 50s. I turned to comfort her as she climbed into my arms. 'It's okay, sweetheart. She loves you so much. And don't tell your cousins, but I'm _pretty sure_ you were totally her favorite.' While she still doesn't quite understand death, she's nonetheless intrigued by the idea that everyone will someday just...not be here anymore.\n\nDeath is a tragic inevitability that's fascinated humans from the very beginning. In fact, it's something just about everybody does their best to avoid. After all, where do we go when the curtains close and the stage is empty? When is it _my_ time to go? Even in faith, we simply don't know with any degree of certainty. Though as many wise people before us have posited, Death is dark and beautiful. It's what gives meaning to the precious time we have.\n\n'You know, we have a lot of really good pictures of you and grandma Cheri. She absolutely adored you, kiddo.'\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/mvdbnjY/precious-little-time.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\n## _'Remember that you die'_\n\n> _**Momento Mori**_\n> Latin. pronounced _/məˈmɛntoʊ ˈmɔːri/_, _mə-MEN-toh MOR-ee_\n> • Memento is the 2nd person singular active imperative of meminī, 'to remember, to bear in mind,' usually serving as a warning: \"remember!\"\n> • Morī is the present infinitive of the deponent verb morior 'to die'\n\nI first heard about [CryptoMories](https://cryptomories.iwwon.com) from my [@DeadFreaksNFT](https://twitter.com/deadfreaksnft) fam on their [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZEgh3aCZhm) server, but it wasn't until maybe a day or so later that I caught my first glimpse of a Morie. 'Well _these_ look friggin' awesome. Might be a good project to write about too.' After sharing the project with my good friends and colleagues, [Brynn](https://twitter.com/vanbrohenheim_1) and [Reece](https://twitter.com/reecesmith_ark) ([@HelloMSQ](https://twitter.com/hellomsq)), and doing some basic DYOR, it became apparent that CryptoMories was well-worth turning into a Discovery of the Day.\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/xjNnHW6/cryptomories-nfts.gif)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n<b>Needless to say, my friends have great taste</b>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nCryptoMories is a collection of 10,000 ERC-721 NFTs registered on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) Blockchain and stored via [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) where they'll forever serve as reminders to step away from NFTs and glowing screens to enjoy life.\n\nBeyond the already great art and meaning behind the project, I was also surprised to discover that CryptoMories builds around an entire ecosystem of current and future collectibles co-created and led by artist and eponymous project creator [iwwon](https://twitter.com/iwwon_official), the first of which was [Los Samos NFTs](https://twitter.com/los_samos). Owners of Los Samos' 125 hand-made NFTs are whitelisted for future projects along with fellow Morie holders, with all having early access to future releases.\n\nTheir team is currently focused on community building and outreach centered on mutual respect and support with an emphasis on mental health needs, and it shows. When I spoke to CryptoMories Discord admin, Tad, earlier today, they expressed how it's ''...wonderful to see so many helpful and excited community members taking on leadership roles just to help and support one another.' And they were right. I've gotta say, it really is a refreshing thing to see.\n\nThere's so much tribalism and crap talk in and around the crypto and NFT space, but the Mories team and community genuinely care about and are supportive of one another. In my opinion, not _just_ something needed, but something that's entirely necessary. We always go further together, and humans need a bit of humanity and unity, or we're just [ngmi](http://ngmi.urbanup.com/14326153#.YY8EDFYSsjU).\n\n![](twitter:iwwon_official/status/1454048658207526912)\n\n## What's Comin' Up for CryptoMories?\n\nWhile the CryptoMorie Roadmap itself is undergoing some tweaks to help clarify the timeline and order of upcoming releases, there's plenty to look forward to.\n\nThe Vandals and Cool Apes NFT projects are currently in development and will be available to Los Samos and Cryptomories holders. There are also plans for introducing lots of utility and potential tokenization features as their projects expand and reach their later stages.\n\nThere are plenty of other surprises in the coming months too, including merch and giveaways and even 3D metaverse avatars that will be used in their planned series of iwwon games (yes, this team was initially a gaming studio).\n\n![](twitter:cryptomories/status/1456414000963489794)\n\n## Sincerely Solemn Stats\n\nAll 10,000 CryptoMories NFTs have been minted, but you can still find them on the secondary market via [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptomories)\n\n* **Smart Contract** - [0x1a2f71468f656e97c2f86541e57189f59951efe7](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1a2f71468f656e97c2f86541e57189f59951efe7)\n\n_Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information._\n\n* **Available Items** - 10K\n* **Owners** - 3.7K\n\nFollow _CryptoMories_ on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cryptomories) and join them on [Discord](https://discord.gg/EYT3ycyT6s) to catch the latest updates or even if you just need someone to talk to.

From Monday to Friday we bring you our Discovery of the Day featuring some of our top picks for NFTs, DeFi protocols, Blockchain Games and more. In today's article we take a closer look at the Ape City, specifically those simians running it...The Ape Gang!***\n\n## The Ape Gang Collection\n\nHidden in the dense jungles of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain are Apes, but not just your garden variety chimps. No no, these Apes have been stalking nearby human civilizations for centuries—watching their every move. The Apes waited patiently until the time was right to overtake a neighboring city and replace the humans populating it, and that's exactly what they proceeded to do. After they settled in various parts of what was to become known as *Ape City*, multiple gangs of apes with different personas formed: good guys, bad guys, crazy guys, chilled guys, weird guys, scary guys...the only question is—which one will you join?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/H6nwtLY.gif)\n\n> No more monkey business!? *Only* monkey business!\n\n[Ape Gang](https://apegang.art/) is a collection of 10,000 programmatically generated NFTs on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. Each Ape is entirely unique and synthesized from 149 possible traits including headgear, eyes, ears, mouths, clothing and even fur color! The collection also includes some extra special 1/1 Apes. Each Ape Gang holder gains full ownership over their Ape(s) as well as commercial usage rights, meaning they may do whatever they see fit with their new property.\n\nLet's take a peep at what these stupendous simians look like:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XqWTw5C.png)\n\n> They don't call him a party animal for nothin'...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Nj02tfR.png)\n\n> *No, I am your [father!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lOT2p_FCvA)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/A4Nlirs.png)\n\n> This is actually the one I myself own...he's a hardcore gamer (just like me)\n\nThis marvelous collection is surrounded by a loving community and run by a diligent team of NFT enthusiasts. These lovable Apes were created by the skillful [Rikong](https://twitter.com/RikongNFT) & [Jokong](https://twitter.com/jokongNFT). Be sure to check them out and show them some love! ❤\n\nThe Ape Gang project is pretty extensive, and we have a lot of ground to cover still, believe it or not. So let's dive headfirst into what they've been up to lately and what they have planned for the future.\n\n### #UnleashTheToucans\n\nToucans are the fierce flying companions of Ape Gangs that will play an important role in determining the outcome of Gang Wars. Toucans were airdropped free of charge (gas fees not included) to Ape Gang holders and are created from over 140 possible traits including headgear, eyes, beaks, clothes and feathers. Take a look at this fine specimen:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/D1y2i3X.png)\n\n> ***Fun fact:** The word 'toucan' comes from the sound the bird makes. Their songs often resemble the cacophonous croaking of frogs*\n\n### Gang Wars\n\nThe Apes are in the midst of a serious suburban war! That's right, Ape Gangs are going head-to-head in the center of Ape City, all fighting with the same goal in mind: to emerge victorious and reign supreme over Ape City! Season 1 Gang Wars will take place very soon in a text-based game on Ape Gang's [Discord.](https://discord.com/invite/apegang) Gangs of 50 apes under the command of skilled leaders will battle against each other in order to gain the upper hand. Jaguar NFT prizes will be awarded to those gangs that manage to prevail over their adversaries.\n\nIn addition, every Ape that participates in the Gang War will receive at least one jaguar coin, which can then be converted into a jaguar NFT. What's that? More utility for being part of the Ape Gang project? Yes indeed! Jaguar NFTs are exactly like Toucans in that they will play an important role in the upcoming Gang War and the seasons that follow. So join the Ape Gang Discord, enlist in the gang you'd like to be part of and prepare for war. As [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) once famously uttered:\n\n> *'We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing-grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender!'*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cIriZD0.gif)\n\n### Ape Gang Featured in NYC\n\nThe Ape Gang collection recently featured on the 'Express Store' billboard (The North East Corner of 46th Street & 7th Avenue, New York City) from Friday October 22nd to Sunday October 24th 2021. Just look at this!\n\n![](twitter:ApeGangNFT/status/1455232947506843661?s=20)\n\n### Supporting the Rainforest Foundation US\n\nNot only does Ape Gang provide plenty of utility to its holders, but it also assists charities like [The Rainforest Foundation US](https://rainforestfoundation.org/) in their mission to protect natural habitats across the world’s remaining rainforests. So far Ape Gang has managed to donate 20 ETH and is currently looking at different ways to support this noble cause.\n\n### The Ape Gang Metaverse\n\nYup, that's right! We're not finished yet! The Ape Gang is in the process of building its own Metaverse for Ape Gang holders. Just take a peek at some of the teasers the team have released thus far:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ATajHcx.gif)\n\n> The first official character for the Ape Gang Metaverse\n\nThe team also gave Ape Gang followers a sneak peak of the upcoming Ape Gang Metaverse world...it already looks pretty immersive to me!\n\n![](twitter:ApeGangNFT/status/1457854290719084550?s=20)\n\n## The Ape Gang Team is Going Bananas!\n\nNo way...there can't be more, right? Well, you're wrong again! The team is currently making its way through the Ape Gang 3.0 Roadmap, and boy is there plenty more to come! The latest Roadmap includes items like 3D Ape Figurines, the $GANG token release, an iOS Ape Gang game, developing the Ape Gang Metaverse, and, of course...Season 1 of Gang Wars! \n\nThere's such an enormous number of things the team are working on that I don't even have time to discuss it all. For this reason, if you want to keep up-to-date with what's going on, you can view the current Roadmap below and sign up for The Ape Gang's [newsletter,](https://apegang.medium.com/the-peel-november-6th-2021-8bf315879a74) aptly dubbed *The Peel* 🍌\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yZ4P3nH.jpg)\n\n> [Ape Gang 3.0 Roadmap](https://apegang.art/#roadmap)\n\n## Apetastic Stats\n\nThe Ape Gang collection is sold out, but you can still get yourself one (or two, or three) of these battle-ready Apes over on The Ape Gang [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/ape-gang) page. Now on to some stats...\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\n\n* **Total Items** - 10K\n* **Owners** - 4K\n\nIn short, Ape Gang is a really awesome NFT project you should watch closely. Be sure to give them a follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ApeGangNFT) and join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/apegang) so that you can participate in the action-packed Gang Wars with your very own Ape!\n\nFor now we must leave these belligerent beasts to their own devices, but fear not! There's a ton of other stuff for you to explore here on MSQ, and we bring you new finds and stories on the regular, so keep your ears open and eyes **peeled!** at all times (yes, we went there!)

As we speak, evil forces are conspiring to take over the Metaverse...*our* Metaverse! Now we've got plenty of ammo and enough spirit to make an old Sea Captain tear up, but we need the numbers if we're ever gonna win this.\n\nSo I ask you now—are you ready to serve? Are you ready to fight back against this tyranny and save the Metaverse from centralized subjugation? What would you give to see this happen? Would you sacrifice your way of life? Your freedom?\n\nWell don't worry...we don't expect you to make any sacrifices like that.

Just imagine [Ready Player One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jawWLE-wDsk) right here, right now—that's about the best way I can describe the current iteration of the Metaverse. Now as time marches on and the Metaverse becomes evermore interwoven into our daily routines, there's little doubt that we'll be needing some kind of fighting force to keep those visiting and using the Metaverse in check! And this, my friends, is exactly where [Soldiers of the Metaverse](https://www.metaarmy.io/) comes in: to defend the Metaverse against all those who wish to corrupt or destroy it!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Edwvd3j.gif)\n\nSoldiers of the Metaverse is an exclusive collection of 7,500 futuristic battle ready soldiers standing their ground on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) Blockchain. It goes without saying that these soldiers are prepared to defend the Metaverse at any cost. Each capable soldier is randomly generated from over 150 different traits. As an added bonus, every holder gains a share of the copyright/licensing of the soldier (or soldiers) they hold.\n\nDespite their outward toughness and fortitude, The Soldiers of the Metaverse really care about doing good and giving back to the world. This is why they have committed themselves towards contributing to charities across the globe. So Soldiers of the Metaverse not only exist to defend the future, but they also protect the present. The SotM team will post each charitable donation in real-time and intends to pledge 10% of the mint & royalties to helping charities such as the ones listed below:\n\n* [Unicef](https://www.unicef.org/)\n* [Doctors Without Borders (Médecins sans frontières)](https://www.msf.org/)\n* [Wounded Warrior Project](https://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/)\n\nThe aesthetic talent behind this incredible project is [Carlos Dattoli](https://www.instagram.com/carlosdattoliart/), a professional illustrator & concept artist who works exclusively in the Pop Culture industry.

It's safe to say this guy is a total genius when it comes to creating highly polished and striking digital designs.\n\nNow let's line up the troops and see what soldiers of the future look like...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WXO98Rc.png)\n\n> Lieutenant Dan Droid realized he had overdressed for the party...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0feVrBY.png)\n\n> Is that [Homer Simpson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtEFEdrrXc4&ab_channel=LeahHeflin) in that suit!?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4teJGtN.png)\n\n> I'm sensing some [Power Rangers](https://powerrangers.hasbro.com/worldwide) inspiration here\n\n## Reconnoitering the Roadmap\n\nThere are no breaks in the world of war. With this in mind, the team are pushing forward with an ambitious campaign that takes no prisoners! As it stands, the General has the soldiers fighting on two different fronts, namely the Promotional and Utility Battles. In this sense, one could argue that Soldiers of the Metaverse has two concurrent and interconnected Roadmaps with several items contained within each. I'm sure you can guess that, with two Roadmaps, the ongoing work is extensive. Check out our reworked version of their Roadmap below:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CWW0Fxb.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IaVY5rM.png)\n\nIf you wish to view the Roadmap in its original form, simply navigate to the Soldiers of the Metaverse [official website](https://www.metaarmy.io/) and check it out there.\n\n## Recruitment Stats\n\nThe Soldiers of the Metaverse collection is sold out, but you can still grab yourself one or more of these hyper-effective warriors over on the SotM [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/the-soldiers-of-the-metaverse) page. And now let's take a brief look at some stats...\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\n\n* **Total Items** - 7.5K\n* **Owners** - 2.5K\n\nSoldiers of the Metaverse is certainly pushing hard to remain active and grow their community, so it's a project you're going to want to keep yor eye on. Be sure to give them a follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MetaverseArmy) and join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/metaarmy) so that you can receive all the latest intel and mission briefings from Soldiers of the Metaverse.\n\nWell cadet, it looks like you're past your basic training. Who knows? Keep this up, and you may just survive this world. However, do not become complacent...this is just the first step on a much more profound journey. So I ask you soldier, with all the conviction I have in my heart...\n\n*Are your ready to fight for a better world?*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/H1nkeTT.jpg)\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) on SubStack, and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar)* on Twitter.\n\n*We will be hosting giveaways for eligible members on the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) every Friday at 7PM UTC.

MSQ's Discovery of the Day runs five days a week and features some of our top picks from across the cryptosphere. Whether it's Non-Fungible Tokens, DeFi protocols, Blockchain-based games or everything wrapped into one, you can find it right here on MSQ. Today's entry comes from a true visionary in the NFT space. If you're not already familiar with his work, well, now's the time. Say hello to SuperNfty's IMPS!***\n\n## Getting A Head with No Body to Stop You\n\n> Ever wanted to just detach your head from your body and, I dunno...float around doing nothing in particular?\n>\n> No?\n>\n> OK, it's probably just me then...\n\nIn all seriousness, it's great being a human being and stuff, but we do have to spend a *lot* of time looking after ourselves. Now, bodies have their uses, there's no debating that, but...they also require quite a lot of attention. I mean, think about it—you have to clean them, exercise them, protect them (and failing that, heal them), let them rest, cool them down, warm them up. I think you get the idea.\n\nYou think I'm advocating some kind of astral projection or something, don't you? Well, it's not like that. Not at all. I'm simply saying that bodies require maintenance and that gravity is a bore. Who knows? Somewhere, in some far-flung part of the galaxy, there may very well be a race of aliens that live in a low gravity environment and are just disembodied heads. *You can't disprove it!*\n\nRight, so you probably want an explanation for all this rambling, don't you? Well, in order to do that, I need to give you a brief NFT History lesson, so settle in my friends...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0ptFCn3.gif)\n\n## SuperNfty\n\nIn the past few months we've covered a bunch of NFT projects, but [SuperNfty's](https://www.supernfty.com/) style is unlike anything I've seen before. SuperNfty is a 3D artist (or VRtist, if you prefer) hailing from Belgium. Crafting his signature infamous 1/1 floating heads in Virtual Reality, SuperNfty recently completed his full collection of 264 [Floating Heads](https://www.supernfty.com/floating-heads.html) which come complete with AR-models, 3D print files, a webcam face-filter, profile picture and an MP4 of the Floating Head. After successfully completing the Floating Head Roadmap, SuperNfty has ventured forward with his next endeavors, [Superballs](https://www.superballsnft.com/) & [IMPS](https://www.supernfty.com/imps.html).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3HzFrY0.gif)\n\n> SuperNfty's Floating Heads\n\n### Superballs\n\nSuperballs is a relatively small collection of 3,000 doodles drawn by SuperNfty himself. Every Floating Head holder received 10 Superballs free of charge as a thank you for their loyalty and support. The Superballs were originally created to reward OG Floating Head holders and to play a role in the next upcoming collection, **IMPS**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qdE8wVz.gif)\n\n## IMPS\n\nFinally, this leads us to SuperNfty's next collection, IMPS. Slated for release in December, IMPS is a collection of 10,000 randomly generated, fully-animated 3D heads levitating across the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. Every IMP is synthesized from 250 different traits and more than 30 color palettes. Each trait has been expertly handcrafted in VR by SuperNfty in his signature floating head style.\n\nSo if you wanna grab yourself an IMP, there are several ways to obtain a whitelist pass for free. Simply check out the **#imps-whitelist** channel in SuperNfty's [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/supernfty) for more info. Oh yeah, Discord members can also watch live streams, participate in creativity contests, enter giveaways and much, much more. Something else worth noting is that Superballs act as a presale pass for IMPS. What this means is, if you have a Superball in your possession, you can get yourself on that whitelist no problem! Isn't that just...super...nifty? Haha!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6lbZRgW.gif)\n\nI'm not done yet. Get this, SuperNfty is also in the process of creating Honorary IMPS as a special thank you to early supporters of his collection! Just take a look at the first Honorary IMP created specially for SuperNfty's first-ever supporter:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lJuw4m2.gif)\n\n> ***'I wanted to do something special for my first & biggest supporter, [@adinalini](https://twitter.com/adinalini)'***\n\nSuperNfty decided to create a 10k project of his own owing to the fact that certain generative NFT projects he's seen have inspired him to do so. As SuperNfty himself puts it:\n\n> *'In many ways, a 10k project is like the \"final boss\" for collectible creators.\"*\n\nGiven the body of SuperNfty's existing work, I think it's safe to say that this move is the next logical step forward for him as an artist and pioneer. With the incredible success of his first hand-modeled collection, SuperNfty has already established himself as a unique creator with vision, drive and foresight. Regardless of what work you hold by this Belgian wunderkind, you can be certain that its value will only accrue over the next few years.\n\n## IMP In!\n\nSuperNfty is hardworking, innovative and dedicated, meaning that his work's style and utility is virtually unsurpassed in a number of key respects. Needless to say, I'm champing at the bit to see just how far SuperNfty's IMPS will go. Now if you want to get yourself an IMP, check out the dates below and have your wallet at the ready 👀\n\n* **Presale (December 17th 2021)** - 0.03 ETH\n* **Public Sale (December 21st 2021)** - 0.05 ETH\n\nDon't miss out on this. Plan ahead (get it?), set reminders, write it on your forehead, and if you can't do it yourself, laminate a sticky note to your face (OK, don't do that). All I'm saying is, this collection could very well sell out in record time...\n\nThat about does it for this Discovery of the Day. Ensure that you follow SuperNfty on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SuperNfty) and join his [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/supernfty) so that you get all the latest info as it drops. Additionally, if you'd like to watch SuperNfty designing the IMPS live, you can follow him over on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/supernfty).\n\nAnyway amigos, thanks for joining me on this journey. Take care of yourselves and see you around the Metaverse!

      "body": "***Hello and welcome to another fantastic Discovery of the Day! From Monday to Friday, we here at MSQ put together in-depth articles on some of our top finds from the realms of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols and Blockchain-based games. Today we are proud to bring you an exciting initiative seeking to democratize the Metaverse and allow players to determine how it all comes together. This is The Sandbox!***\n\n## Life in Another World\n\nThe gaming industry is big, and by big, I mean incontrovertibly massive. According to a [report](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/global-gaming-industry-value-now-exceeds-300-billion-new-accenture-report-finds.htm) by Accenture, as of April 2021, the total value of the global gaming industry is estimated to be over $300 billion. Moreover, the number of players has increased by 500 million over the past three years, and over 400 million more are expected to join by the end of 2023. With the state of the global economy and preventative measures imposed upon human populations to combat the spread of COVID-19, more and more people are turning to Information Technology for answers. As such, more and more people are working remotely and socializing in digital spaces.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gSHYYCE.png)\n\n> Graphic courtesy of [Accenture,](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/global-gaming-industry-value-now-exceeds-300-billion-new-accenture-report-finds.htm) 2021\n\nThings aren't changing...they've already changed. And in fact, many of these changes are taking root, causing humans to fundamentally adapt their ways of thinking, acting and being productive. Life is taking on an interesting new shape, and from what it appears, the metaverse is going to play a key role in ushering in this new paradigm. The great thing about virtual worlds is that the possibilities and concomitant opportunities they present are practically without limit. By leveraging the power of Blockchain technology and crypto, the metaverse will be able to provide users with meaningful ways to engage in transactions, build assets and infrastructure and make a living for themselves from virtually anywhere in the world.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ip88ypR.gif)\n\n## The Playground of Imagination\n\nI'm reasonably sure that almost everyone is at least aware of [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) and that a good chunk of you have played or are currently playing it. In a recent [article](https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-live-2021-numbers-update) by Zachary Boddy of Windows Central, there are around 141 million active monthly users playing Minecraft (according to August 2021 figures). While this is an impressive number, it pales in comparison with [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/) which, according to Brian Dean of [Backlinko](https://backlinko.com/roblox-users), had about 202 million monthly users as of April 2021. Many more players have joined these two highly popular games over the last months, most likely as a result of the ongoing COVID Pandemic and other factors related to it, and if trends continue as they are, this number will continue to grow for the foreseeable future.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YV4tEN7.jpg)\n\nSo are Minecraft and Roblox the be all end all of sandbox games and game creation platforms? Not by a long shot. I'd like to bring your attention to a project that takes some of the best components of these two games and combines them with the best of Blockchain tech and the Metaverse. Yes indeed, [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/) is what you might consider a 'Metaverse ecosystem' that runs on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. In this virtual world, players can build, own and monetize their gaming experience and assets. The Sandbox's native ERC-20 token, $SAND, may be traded, staked and used to take part in the governance and evolution of the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nThe Sandbox ain't no rinky-dink fly-by-night project. Seeing that it has well over 300K followers on Twitter (most of which seem to be legitimate followers and *not* bots), as well as a metric ton of existing NFT and crypto projects (and even established brands) actively purchasing land, it's safe to say it's very, very popular.\n\n## Pieces of the Grand Puzzle\n\nThe Sandbox has only really started out, but it's already pretty extensive in terms of what it offers to end users. When you visit their [official website,](https://www.sandbox.game/) you'll see a couple of navigation buttons to the left that read, *Home*, *Market (Beta)*, *Create*, *Map* and *About.* Each of these buttons will provide you with some useful insights into the ever-growing universe that is The Sandbox.\n\n> You can also check out this convenient [One Pager](https://installers.sandbox.game/The_Sandbox_One_Pager_2020.pdf) on the Sandbox if you really want to learn a whole lot via one source\n\nSo let's dive into the various moving parts that constitute The Sandbox and discuss their significance and utility in some detail...\n\n### Game Maker\n\nMaybe you've had a great idea for a game but never really known how to go about doing it. Well, thanks to The Sandbox's built-in [Game Maker,](https://www.sandbox.game/en/create/game-maker/) users will be able to build, share and monetize their very own games on The Sandbox's highly customizable 3D gaming platform. The best part of all this? No prior coding knowledge is required! That's right, even if you have zero experience with coding, you will still be able to bring your own games and stories into being. Take a look at this video that demonstrates what users can create using The Sandbox Game Maker:\n\n![](youtube:uDkf1CrkF7Y)\n\n### Marketplace\n\nArguably one of the most important parts of The Sandbox is its [NFT Marketplace](https://www.sandbox.game/en/shop/) (currently in its Beta phase). In essence, the Marketplace is an open market that permits the free trading of tokenized in-game ASSETS that serves as the primary dashboard of The Sandbox.\n\nWith regards to token types, The Sandbox makes use of four, namely SAND (ERC-20), LAND (ERC-721), ASSETS (ERC-1155) and GEMS (ERC-20). These tokens exist to ensure that a circular economy develops and is maintained within The Sandbox. These tokens are used by all members of the platform: players, creators, curators and land owners. The following diagram illustrates the nature and utility of these tokens in a little more detail:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/47BTUiw.png)\n\n### Voxel Editor\n\nOK, now this is seriously cool. So if you want to be able to create your own NFTs, you can make use of The Sandbox's [VoxEdit](https://www.voxedit.io/) which allows you to model, animate and create NFTs that can then be sold and traded on The Sandbox Marketplace! And again, no real coding knowledge is required here. As one reviewer eloquently put it:\n\n> *'...it's the fusion of a modeling editor with an animation system all in the same software.'*\n\nJust take a look at the different components within VoxEdit and I think you'll see how this integrated and user-friendly approach to modeling and NFT creation is truly ingenious:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TQtjsCC.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R74OfsK.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UH9Qs6O.png)\n\n### The Map\n\nYes, it somehow gets better and better the more you look into it. The Sandbox allows users to purchase virtual real estate alongside more than 160 well-known brands, companies and celebrities including [Atari,](https://www.atari.com/) [The Smurfs,](https://www.smurf.com/) [Care Bears](https://www.carebears.com/) and [Snoop Dogg.](https://snoopdogg.com/) As an added bonus, users can rent out their virtual real estate to others for a fee or purchase NFTs and populate it with content in order to increase its value. There will only ever be 166,464 LANDS available, and if you take a look at the map below, it's clear that a lot of it has already been bought up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dYKQgoi.png)\n\nOh, and if you want to know exactly what you can do with LAND in The Sandbox, this handy graphic should summarize all you need to know:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KBis0Yj.png)\n\n### The Game\n\nNaturally, The Sandbox also offers users the ability to play and experience games created by other users. What does this mean? Unlimited possibilities of course. The Sandbox allows users to create content and experiences for one another, encouraging participation and community-based innovation. In short, if you're part of The Sandbox, and you somehow get bored...you're doing it wrong.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IIi7MiK.png)\n\n### Partners\n\nAs I touched on earlier, The Sandbox has a ton of brands, celebrities and organizations they have partnered with and that are already actively involved in The Sandbox. Here's just a handful of the prestigious names they have partnered with:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/G2jUEGy.png)\n\n## Like Sand Through the Hourglass\n\nSo the next question is 'What does the Sandbox plan to do next?' Or maybe the better question to ask is 'What *don't* they plan on doing?' With an extensive Roadmap that goes all the way back to 2011 and up till 2023, it's safe to say that the team behind The Sandbox takes their work very, very seriously. Here's just what's in store for Q4 of 2021 and the first two quarters of 2022:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PoUwWoE.png)\n\nFor the full detailed Roadmap extending from 2011 to 2023, click [here](https://www.sandbox.game/en/roadmap/) and you'll be routed to the relevant page on The Sandbox's official website.\n\n### Open Metaverse Alpha\n\nIn a few days, The Sandbox Metaverse Alpha will be available for testing. The best part? It's open to everyone! Anyone will be able to access the Alpha HUB as well 3 unique experiences. However, Alpha Pass holders will have access to all 18 exclusive experiences and earn up to 1,000 $SAND and 3 NFTs in rewards! The Alpha runs from November 29th till December 20th 2021. Check out the details below!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MawFbUy.png)\n\nFor full information on this event, please visit The Sandbox's [official website](https://www.sandbox.game/)\n\n## A Sea of Stats\n\nThere are a mind-boggling 860 [ASSETS](https://opensea.io/collection/sandbox?search[sortBy]=PRICE&search[sortAscending]=true&search[stringTraits][0][name]=Type&search[stringTraits][0][values][0]=Asset) and well over 100,000 [LANDs](https://opensea.io/collection/sandbox?search[sortAscending]=true&search[sortBy]=PRICE&search[stringTraits][0][name]=Type&search[stringTraits][0][values][0]=Land) currently available on The Sandbox's [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/sandbox). You can also buy/sell/trade from the platform's circulating supply of 705 million ERC-20 [$SAND](https://www.sandbox.game/about/sand) utility tokens that are used for value transfers as well as staking and governance participation. Let's take a look at a couple of stats...\n\n### **Smart Contracts**\n\n- **ASSETs** - [0xa342f5d851e866e18ff98f351f2c6637f4478db5](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa342f5d851e866e18ff98f351f2c6637f4478db5)\n- **LANDs** - [0x50f5474724e0ee42d9a4e711ccfb275809fd6d4a](https://etherscan.io/token/0x50f5474724e0ee42d9a4e711ccfb275809fd6d4a)\n- **$SAND Token** - [0x3845badAde8e6dFF049820680d1F14bD3903a5d0](https://etherscan.io/token/0x3845badAde8e6dFF049820680d1F14bD3903a5d0)\n\n_Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information._\n\n- **Available ASSET/LAND Items** - 101.3K\n- **ASSET/LAND Owners** - 14.2K\n- **$SAND Supply** - 3 billion (705 million in circulation)\n\nWell now, that was a trip! I actually wish I could go on, but The Sandbox is literally so extensive I would need at least another post to really cover it all in a sufficient amount of detail. I think the proof is in the pudding here. I highly recommend that you follow The Sandbox on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thesandboxgame) and join them on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/vAe4zvY) so that you can get to know the team, talk to the community and learn more about this fascinating Metaverse ecosystem.\n\nI'm absolutely staggered by the level of depth and detail The Sandbox already possesses. Thanks for joining me on this amazing Discovery of the Day. That's all for now. Until next time Blockchain fans, keep it decentralized and keep your minds open to the many great opportunities around you!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Hs8m3Ku.png)\n\n> *For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) on SubStack, and don't forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar)* on Twitter.\n\n---\n\n*We will be hosting giveaways for eligible members on the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.gg/eesCgQWw7n) every Friday at 3PM EST.

Did you know that the world consumes more than 11 million pounds of food every minute of every day? That's a whole lot of burgers, pineapple pizzas, hotdogs, pumpkin pies, you name it...But this only begs the question, 'How much food will be consumed per day in the Metaverse!?'

Here's a list of some of the things you can get up to in OneRare's Foodverse:\n\n* **Farm** - Play-to-Earn Land where farmers grow ingredient crops\n* **Farmer's Market** - Farmers sell their ripe produce to collectors\n* **Kitchen** - Read Recipes & combine ingredients to mint dishes\n* **Playground** - NFT Owners battle in Mini Games\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bPHW7qQ.png)\n\n> The OneRare Foodverse\n\nThe Foodverse will be powered by $ORARE, OneRare's native token that will allow you to carry out all four of the aforementioned activities as well as some others including governance and unlocking in-game upgrades.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WiHd1mf.png)\n\nThe OneRare Foodverse will be powered by NFTs and include everything from NFT Ingredients to NFT Dishes. OneRare wants to bring NFTs to life by allowing users to swap OneRare NFTs for meals & deals in restaurants worldwide, gain access to celebrity chefs and much more. Each Dish has a recipe akin to real life meals with players being able to claim unique Dish NFTs by following these recipes. You can test your cooking skills right now by trying out their current [test version!](https://one-rare-test.onrender.com/)\n\n### *'My Compliments to the Chefs'*\n\nNaturally, creating the first-ever Foodverse requires a passionate, hardworking team! The OneRare team is headed by two well-respected individuals within the cryptoverse, namely [Supreet Raju](https://twitter.com/supreetraju) and [Gaurav Gupta](https://twitter.com/gaurav_gupta9).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rQOLhoe.png)\n\nOneRare is also backed by many reputable partners including:\n\n- [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/)\n- [Enjin](https://enjin.io/)\n- [Blockchain Game Alliance](https://www.blockchaingamealliance.org/)\n- and more...\n\nThe project also has a wide array of supporters or 'Angels' as they call them, directly contributing towards OneRare's development!\n\n> For a full list of OneRare's Angels and Partners, please visit their [official website](https://onerare.io/)\n\n## What's on the Menu?\n\nOneRare has already hit several milestones on their Roadmap, but they're not delaying the next course! Throughout the next few months the team will be focusing their efforts on fulfilling objectives such as the creation of a Mobile Gaming Layer, the establishment of a DAO, collaborations with celebrity chefs, NFT airdrops and so much more. For your convenience, we've reworked their current Roadmap which you can view below 👇\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DsOMbx3.png)\n\n## Fingerlickin' Stats\n\nWe've covered OneRare in a fair amount of detail today, but if you'd like to learn even more about the project, you can do so by visiting their [website](https://onerare.io/) and reading their [whitepaper](https://onerare.gitbook.io/docs/).\n\nYou can get involved in the OneRare Foodverse by following them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/onerarenft) and joining their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/PraTB9vm5T).

From Monday to Friday we bring you our Discovery of the Day, a series of special articles featuring some of our top picks from across the cryptosphere. Be it DeFi, NFTs, Blockchain games or otherwise, we cover all the important stuff you need to know! Meow it's time fur today's edition...It's Cat Bricks Clubhouse!***\n\n## The Building Blocks of Community\n\nThe foundation of anything great is the people behind it. In the case of crypto projects, this comes down to a range of factors including developers, team members, partners and the community at large. If any of these crucial pieces are missing or lacking in any way, then the chances of the project succeeding are significantly diminished. In order for any project to last, there has to be enough belief behind it, but even this isn't enough on its own—in essence, every single brick needs to be in place if you want to build something that's going to last. Otherwise...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hIUYS7T.gif)\n\n> It all comes tumbling down!\n\nIf a project has all the right elements and the right guiding philosophy, it can accomplish some truly incredible things. The world of crypto is full of several great examples. While there isn't any exact 'formula' to making this all work, some projects manage to find their own way through the many challenges that await them on their journey.\n\n[Cat Bricks Clubhouse](https://catbricks.club/) is a generative NFT project consisting of 5,555 unique NFTs that have been programmatically created from over 150 different hand-sculpted traits. Under the careful artistic supervision of [Offset](https://twitter.com/ooffsett) and Humza, Cat Bricks Clubhouse aims to provide innovative, detailed and meaningful art and utility to the realm of NFTs.\n\nEvery single Cat Bricks NFT is provably rare and exists as an ERC-721 token on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. Each one of the Cat Bricks consists of 5 components, namely background, body, clothing, headgear and facial expression.\n\nSo now you must be asking, 'What do these Cat Bricks actually look like?' That's an excellent question. Let's take a look right now:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zZppIK1.png)\n\n> This is what happens when you're on an interplanetary mission and you forget to live...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b4LJawc.png)\n\n> This feller right here is a big fan of [NASCAR](https://www.nascar.com/) and big rigs\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oEYl0a1.png)\n\n> As happy as a Cat Brick in the Metaverse!\n\n## Episode 1\n\nMost projects have a traditional Roadmap, but in the case of Cat Bricks, it's different Episodes with different Acts! At present the project is on Episode I (kinda like Star Wars, you know?) Anyway, check out what this Episode has going on:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/V2CTgEP.png)\n\nInformation regarding Episode II is yet to be released, but be sure to follow Cat Bricks Clubhouse closely so you don't miss out on any of the latest developments.\n\n> You can check out FAQs on Cat Bricks Clubhouse via their [official website](https://catbricks.club/)\n\n## Meowing for a Mint\n\nOK, so Cat Bricks Clubhouse hasn't officially launched as such, but the team is looking at a mint date near the beginning of December. However, this is subject to change at any time. No official launch date has been defined at time of writing, so make sure you keep up with Cat Bricks Clubhouse's social media activity to find out more.\n\nAlthough it's still in its early stages, Cat Bricks Clubhouse looks very promising indeed. Follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/catbricksnft) and be sure to join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4pjzPbp2fK) so that you never miss out on any new developments and are among the first to gain access to some exclusive opportunities.\n\nAnd with that, we are done.

      "name": "60 Days In: A Beginner's Guide to Lost Relics",
      "slug": "60-days-in-a-beginners-guide-to-lost-relics",
      "body": "***I previously wrote an article on Lost Relics when I had just started out. Now with several months of gameplay under my belt, top tier items in my possession, and a much deeper understanding of the game, I believe it's time to give you a personal account of my experience thus far. My hope is that this will serve as a helpful Beginner's Guide and aid in growing the number of new players joining the game and community. So without further ado, let's get into everything I've learned since starting out in Lost Relics...***\n\n# Mistakes Were Made\n\nIf I'm being honest, when I first started playing [Lost Relics,](www.lostrelics.io) I was pretty terrible. No, *seriously* bad actually. But after each poor decision I made, I quickly learned the things I wish I had known beforehand. Strategies, mentalities and wisdom gleaned from numerous challenging experiences have been reinforced by the many friendships I have developed with longtime professional players within the community. So, while I don't want to get into the substance of my original article, I will break down a few things for anyone who hasn't read it (or refresh the memories of those who have):\n\n- Lost Relics is a dungeon crawler game similar to [Diablo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_(video_game)) and [Runescape](https://play.runescape.com/)\n- Games like these require players to enter various dungeons that are randomly generated so that they can search for loot\n- Loot is distributed using Random Number Generated (RNG) systems from slaying monsters and opening chests\n- Lost Relics differs in a few key ways. Firstly, it is built on Blockchain and makes use of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) within a game model known as Play-to-Earn (P2E)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BWcizKO.gif)\n\nSo with that out the way, I think the best place to start is with the things I wish I had known on my first day of Lost Relics.\n\n## Back to the Start\n\nMy first week was rough. I fought and died in dungeons, tried again and completed them, and battled on just to die some more. Dying early causes you to lose key items needed to move into the second tier of the game. I quickly learned the dire consequences of dying and the benefits of obtaining **Blockchain items** that aren't destroyed when your character dies.\n\nJust so you know, you lose *every* non-Blockchain item (known as **virtual items**) when you die. New players are given a couple of virtual items at the start, namely a bow and a sword. Neither of these are actually any good, but if you die on your first attempt, you'll quickly realize just how vital they actually are.\n\nAt the start of the game, you will complete a few simple quests by talking to merchants around the town of Talmuth. These quests give you your first bow and sword, which some people forget to equip before embarking on a dungeon quest. Make sure you aren't one of them. However, even with your new items, don't enter the first dungeon just yet...there a few things you can do to make first adventure less strenuous and risky.\n\nEveryone starts out with a small amount of gold that, in my opinion, should be used to create some food that you can use to heal yourself:\n\n- Head to the **General Store** and buy some *Ceramic Jugs*\n- Next, head to the **Well** located near the **Tavern**\n- After that, locate the **Alchemy Table**. Near it you will find a pile of flour with a limited supply you can take every day for free\n- Once you have your jugs of water and flour, it's time to make some bread at the **Stove**\n- Now that you have some usable food in your inventory, it's time to start grinding\n\n*Be warned though!* It's best to take more food than you think you'll need at first until you are confident enough to know *exactly* how much you'll require—surviving the dungeon is the most important thing, so it's always best to plan for a worse-case scenario. With this in mind, head over to **Adventure Pass** and get ready to enter your first dungeon!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jNIOray.jpg)\n\n> Use the TAB or M key to pull up the map of Talmuth\n\n## Into the Fiery Pits...\n\nNow I'm ashamed to admit it, but for the first couple of dungeons I took a whirl at, I failed to realize I had the ability to execute a heavy attack. Believe it or not, I actually made it to Level 5 before I finally figured this out! I spent a lot of time learning enemy attack motions and at what points to move in order to avoid taking damage from them. At the time there were no in-game tips that directed players to make use of both attack types, but thankfully there are now.\n\nThe heavy attack is your go-to and best bet for clearing dungeons rapidly and safely. This tip may seem elementary, but for anyone who started playing before these prompts knows firsthand, or has met someone (like me) who didn't have a clue about the heavy attack. Heavy attacks use up your blue energy bar which will always recharge itself back to 250.\n\nWhile this will keep enemies at bay for the most part, new players must be aware of fire traps while grinding indoor dungeons (such as the first one). Identifying these traps is vital to surviving these kinds of dungeons as every single on of them has traps. After triggering a few of these and learning the hard way, you should find they start to stand out, so avoiding them should become significantly easier.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Qxex0X7.jpg)\n\n> This trap triggers most often as it blends almost perfectly into the floor\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LSrpJLY.jpg)\n\n> These fire traps are easy to spot and just require a little good timing to dodge\n\nJust about every player within the world of *Lost Relics* has plenty of stories of failed first and second attempts as a result of these traps that deal a whopping *250 damage* over time. Hitting one or two of them can quickly bring your loot grind to a screeching halt and are more than a bit frustrating when you hit several of them. Just remember, it's going to happen, so don't be too hard on yourself.\n\nA tactic that helped me in the beginning was making use of the camera view rotation. The defaults for this are the left and right arrow keys but can be easily remapped in the controls section of settings. At first this process felt awkward, but it eventually became second nature while grinding for loot and racking up XP.\n\nI then learned a method called 'playing the corners.' All you need to do is rotate the view so the direction you're moving in is always towards one of the top two corners of your screen. This allows you to see farther into the next room when using the default 'isometric' camera view. This is highly beneficial in that it provides you with more insight as to what enemies are present and gives you a longer time to prioritize targets to attack first.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vmwJ12Z.jpg)\n\n> Not using the corner technique—restricted view, a lot of nebulous information\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OenvIuY.jpg)\n\n> The same spot using the corner technique—note how the field of view is far more expansive and provides you with critical clues as to what awaits you in the next area\n\nIf you die, don't let it discourage you—it's happened to all of us, and it's going to happen to you. I myself have lost hundreds of thousands of in-game gold from simple mistakes, misclicks, or, more specifically, taking my headphones off to answer a call and not realizing someone was attacking me because I couldn't hear the game!\n\nYeah, that was me, and *man* was that a rough sight to return to: my cold, dead body covered in a pile of virtual items I no longer had! Considering you only get around 300 to 600 gold on average per dungeon run, losing over 100,000 gold in one run...does sting a bit.\n\n## Goals, Skills, and Leveling\n\nSo you can complete dungeons without dying...now what? In my opinion, you should start setting goals and milestones for yourself. This is one of the best ways to keep progressing and avoid getting bogged down by the slow process of leveling up. Other than the obvious mission to find and collect high value NFTs, there are generally only two major goals to work toward: **Combat Level** and **Skill Level**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uFDQCA2.jpg)\n\n> Your Combat Level unlocks **Champion Rewards**, some of which are only accessible by having an active Power Pendant. These rewards are designated with a crown icon\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BSteb2A.jpg)\n\n> Skills got thrust into the spotlight of the meta thanks to an update in late September\n\nWhile both offer their own benefits, most of the community tends to focus on leveling up in-game skills such as Fishing, Mining, Scavenging, Woodcutting, Alchemy, Cooking, Engineering, and Forging. Skills can be leveled up by acquiring tools and harvesting resource nodes. These nodes are designated with icons on the minimap in dungeons, so be sure to keep an eye out for them.\n\nTools are relatively cheap to purchase using gold at the in-game market (**The Royal Emporium**) and easily found using the search filters on the left. Skills are generally paired together in dungeons, only allowing you to level up two of them at a time. Make sure to only bring tools you can actually use, otherwise you risk losing gold carrying unusable ones if you die. The pairings are, for the most part, Mining/Fishing and Scavenging/Woodcutting (though some higher level dungeons mix it up).\n\nFocusing on skill progression goes hand in hand with early players. Before the September update, resource nodes could be mined in all dungeons regardless of the tier. Since the update, skills are now tailored to dungeon difficulty tiers. So even if you have epic quality items and can complete high level dungeons, you will not be able to harvest resources unless you have a skill level to match. So the faster you get tools, the quicker you can increase your skill levels.\n\nTools also greatly improve the potential to attain and save gold by selling resources at the **Royal Emporium** or using them to create items like food or potions. The other four skills rely on the resources gathered from the primary four, so these will increase with the resources you find and use.\n\nCombat skills shouldn't be written off entirely though as some key Levels will drastically improve your ability to complete dungeons. I won't go into all those that I know, but the first big ones are at Level 5, 18, and 20. Reaching Level 5 will give you access to the stash deposit cart located just outside of the **Adventure Pass**—it may cost 5 gold to deposit each item, but the time it saves you will add up to some serious gains.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Wo1yeac.jpg)\n\n> It may cost some gold, but the time it saves is well worth it\n\nThe next and most important of the three is the fourth relic spot that becomes available at Level 18. This allows you to equip four relics in total (once you have them, of course). Relics are arguably more important than weapons in the long run since they provide you with highly advantageous healing options that recharge every time you complete a dungeon.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qcVz7zx.jpg)\n\n> You start the game with access to 3 of 5 Relic spots; unlocking the fourth is critical in the long run\n\nLast but certainly not least, reaching Level 20 increases your max energy recharge moves from 250 to 375. Considering how often you will need to use your heavy attack, which rapidly drains energy, having a higher capacity energy bank means that the average time required to complete dungeons is significantly reduced.\n\n## The Evolving Strategy Guide of Community\n\nThe last thing I will touch on in this Beginner's guide is perhaps the most important of all—*engaging with and asking the community for help.* I have learned beginner tactics all the way to extremely advanced tricks simply by asking people to explain things and by tuning into community streamers. Lost Relics has an amazingly helpful and encouraging community—I have yet to see someone ask a question and *not* have people go into any level of detail needed to explain the answer.\n\nThe absence of toxicity in this community is something that really made me want to be an active part of it in the first place. Coming from AAA title games, I challenge you to find anything close to this within the communities of the extremely popular games of today. Try going into a *Call of Duty* Discord server and asking beginner questions—I would be willing to bet that you won't be met with people eager to help you understand or figure out whatever it is you may be unsure of.\n\nWith changes, new additions, and events coming out regularly, I hope this Guide remains helpful for new players for as long as possible. Regardless of how long this actually might be, the community itself will continue to serve as the primary guide new players need to start their journey. As far as I'm concerned, I will continue to assist both new and old players alike. We are all in this P2E grind together, and I will fight for it to remain that way...\n\nIf you do end up having the pleasure of playing *Lost Relics*, just know that if you ever come across the name *Spizzo*, never hesitate to ask me for any help or guidance you might require. I will always strive to help promote and grow what the player base has already established as the game's community standard.\n\nGood luck on your journey into P2E, and as always, **happy hunting!**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MYxNYX6.png)",

From Monday to Friday we bring you our Discovery of the Day, a series of special articles featuring some of our top picks from across the cryptosphere. Be it DeFi, NFTs, Blockchain games or otherwise, we cover all the important stuff you need to know! Today we explore the work of figurative expressionist artist and NFT creator Gavin Meeler!**_\n\n## Goodwill Hunting\n\nFlorescent lights illuminate scuffed linoleum as second-hand clothes dangle precariously from a well-worn rack. A *Spring Forward: Colorful Shirts* sign hangs in the distance in stark contrast to the scene of an early twenty-something male sporting a baggy black t-shirt shuffling around patiently for the next great find. Being your own boss is a risky endeavor, but this man and his wife likely found some much-needed freedom in their online shop. This undoubtedly showed Gavin Meeler that when you pursue what you love, you just keep moving forward—one foot in front of the other, and the ground *will* come up to meet you. This may have also been something that gave Gavin the time and courage to press on with his biggest passion: expressing himself and portraying the world around him through art.\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/xXGY2b6/goodwill.jpg)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n<i>'This is my hustle. This is my \"job.\" This is my meditation. This is how I get ahead. This is what I choose to do. This is my happiness.'</i>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nI chose to feature Gavin not just because I love his art and the meaning behind it, but because he and his story are sincere and genuine. No YOLO posts on Twitter. No yachts. No flexing. No dunking or negativity. No trying to be anything other than himself—a shy guy who loves art, puts himself out there and wants to see others succeed too.

While it's hard to pin down an exact number, Gavin's art comprises hundreds of unique pieces across multiple collections, amounting to thousands of NFTs that speak to the human experience and what he sees in the world around us. 30% of all proceeds from his art go directly towards supporting other artists by purchasing their works:\n\n<div style=\"width: 90%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/wBcqPj8/creations.png)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n<b>Bored Ape Derivative in the 3rd Dimension—Screaming for help on the inside—Mumble Rap Sucks—Healing #2</b>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nI actually had quite a bit of trouble narrowing down which pieces to showcase in this article because they're all so emotionally provocative. Gavin's work covers some of the more ineffable aspects of the human experience that are not often translated from the world of the abstract to visual mediums: from humor and sorrow to grief and hopefulness, Gavin highlights and addresses the many issues concerning the modern condition, chiefly those related to mental health and personal wellbeing.\n\n<div style=\"width: 90%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/NjXFYST/creations-2.jpg)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n<b>Woman and Man (Despair)—Bill says 'We need to do more'—Trauma the Clown—Sometimes I can't think</b>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nSome of them are hilarious...\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/4VG2hqY/creations-3.png)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n<b>Boomer—Bill wants to box with beeple</b>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n...and some of them are just...friggin' terrifying!\n\n<div style=\"width: 70%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/HBFztgZ/creations-4.jpg)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n<b>Anguish the Clown—Jack the Clown Grinding Teeth—Fallen and I can't turn back</b>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n### Potato Head\n\n[Potato Head](https://opensea.io/collection/potato-head-by-meeler) is a limited collection of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) NFTs hand-drawn by Gavin and released bi-monthly. This series is a recreation of [Mr. Potato Head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Potato_Head) and other iconic toys portrayed as being stuck halfway between human and toy.\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/fnjFzTk/potato-heads.gif)\n\n</div>\n\nThere will only ever be 600 Potato Heads with 180 exclusive reward toys created.

The 1/1 exclusive toys are awarded to the top three holders from each generation.\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/56M0v1T/ape.png)\n\n</div>\n\n### Etherabloom\n\n[Etherabloom](https://opensea.io/collection/etherabloom) is a separate collection of digital crypto flower NFTs with each emotion-filled piece aptly named to touch on all of life's questions. Only 7 out of 10 of these experimental 1/1 flowers have been released so far.\n\n<div style=\"width: 80%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/T2Yn9D0/Etherabloom.png)\n\n**Etherabloom**<br>*(clock-wise from top left)*<br>#1 Empathy, #2 Sensitivity, #3 Kindness, #4 Community, #5 Perspective, #6 Awareness, #7 Happiness\n\n</div>\n\n### Holy Skully\n\n[Holy Skully](https://opensea.io/collection/holy-skully) is a separate 1/1 collection of 6 Skull NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain.

Absolutely ridiculous!\n\n## Heart & Soul\n\nNeedless to say, Gavin Meeler is by far one of _the_ best artists on the scene: A true up-and-comer with talent and humility who pours his heart and soul into every piece. He's definitely someone you should acquaint and familiarize yourself with.\n\nBe sure to follow _Gavin_ on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gavinmeeler) and join his [Discord](https://discord.gg/MQEhMtxp7J) so that you can keep up with the latest news and releases or even just chat with him directly.\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/8zdGNV9/nyc.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nThere are many people in the world who are disingenuous, conniving and greedy. Mercifully, Gavin Meeler isn't one of them. Perhaps one of the most endearing aspects of his work is how his humility, humanity and kindness translate in an expressive, yet entirely relatable way that, despite its strangeness, feels incredibly close to home.\n\nThat about it does it for today.

Be it DeFi, NFTs, Blockchain games or otherwise, we cover all the important stuff you need to know! It's always good when projects acknowledge the contributions of previously disenfranchised members of our society. With this in mind, we are proud to bring you...Women and Weapons!**_\n\n## Standing United Against Oppression\n\nBy the early 1900s, women had become frustrated with the lack of progress on altering legislation to grant them the right to vote and participate in important political decisions. As a direct consequence, the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), also knows as [The Suffragettes,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffragette) was formed by Emily Pankhurst under the mantra of *'Deeds, not words.'*\n\nThe Suffragettes were tired of being treated unfairly, so they decided to take matters into their own hands. The Suffragettes used violent tactics and even acts of subterfuge to claim what they deemed to be rightfully theirs: the right to vote in general elections. The tactics employed by Suffragists ranged from pouring acid on golf courses all the way to arson and bombings.\n\nNeedless to say, after much struggle, ridicule and effort, the WSPU emerged victorious and gained the right to vote under the [Representation of the People Act 1918!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_Act_1918)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NKXrm85.jpg)\n\n> This American World War II wartime poster was produced by J. Howard Miller in 1943 to boost the morale of female workers\n\nWhile classic conventions of femininity tend to enshrine submissiveness, composure and sensitivity, the Suffragettes proved that women can also be strong, aggressive and bold. In many respects, women are the backbone of our society: they are mothers, wives, daughters, carers, fighters, thinkers, inventors...in fact, women are so many things and are vital in keeping the world a thriving, vibrant place.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0wHujPQ.gif)\n\n## Ladylike and Lethal\n\n[Women and Weapons](https://www.womenandweapons.io/) is a collection of 10,000 diverse and delightfully deadly female NFTs living in the domiciles of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. Designed from over 200 different hand-drawn traits, each woman is entirely unique.\n\nOne of the primary goals of Women and Weapons is to raise money for various charities and take advantage of the large platform they are building to make the world a better place. As it so happens, Women and Weapons is donating 5% of their profits to the [Malala Fund,](https://twitter.com/MalalaFund) an organization that advocates and helps to improve the state of secondary education for girls on a global scale. At time of writing, the total amount donated by Women and Weapons stands at $100,000! Now that's really something!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/O0Q4KuG.png)\n\n> **The Malala Fund** works to change the circumstances of young women around the world\n\nSo what exactly do these daring damsels look like? Well, see for yourself!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IOhzhG3.png)\n\n> Wolverine dropped his claws somewhere in Ulyanovsk Oblast...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tAx00O3.png)\n\n> Bare-knuckle beatboxing anyone?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SFNqwjc.png)\n\n> Cynthia decided she had bought the wrong drumsticks\n\nNow the designer behind this stunning collection is the highly gifted [Sara Baumann,](https://twitter.com/NFTSaraBaumann) a multimedia artist from Dallas, Texas. Women and Weapons is Sara's biggest and boldest work to date. However, in addition to creating a distinct and powerful collection, Sara has also been releasing special art pieces as part of her personal 1/1 Genesis Collection—check out this one Sara made for the legendary [GaryVee](https://twitter.com/garyvee)!\n\n![](twitter:garyvee/status/1452021863849230337)\n\n## *Vive la Roadmap!*\n\nThe Women and Weapons team is full of diligent, hardworking and passionate individuals who have much planned for the future. Some items they have listed include airdrops, exclusive merchandise and plans for an extensive Season 2. We would also like to give our heartiest congratulations to Sara for seizing the opportunity to follow her childhood dream of becoming a full-time artist!\n\nTake a look at the full Roadmap below 👇\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b0jIRmo.png)\n\n> You can also find answers to FAQs on Women and Weapons by visiting their [official website](https://www.womenandweapons.io/)\n\n## Empowering Statistics\n\nThe Women and Weapons collection is sold out, but you can still grab yourself one (or maybe even a few?) of these warring women over on the project's [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/womenandweapons) page. Now let's take a look at a couple of stats, shall we?\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\n\n* **Total Items** - 10K\n* **Owners** - 4.9K\n\nWomen and Weapons is making a real difference to the lives of women all over the world and will likely continue along this trajectory for the foreseeable future. It's an amazing project that you shouldn't hesitate to follow and support. So, make sure you do the [Twitter](https://twitter.com/womenandweapons) thing and join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/jfbK5v3Gh6) so that you are always informed about the amazing work the Women and Weapons team is accomplishing!\n\nIt's always great seeing NFT projects that have a conscience and want to give back to the world.

From Monday to Friday we bring you our Discovery of the Day, a series of special articles featuring some of our top picks from across the cryptosphere. Be it DeFi, NFTs, Blockchain games or otherwise, we cover all the important stuff you need to know! Today we bring you a project that promises one new NFT every single day...forever!? How can that be? Let's find out! This is...Nouns!**_\n\n## A Naming Word\n\nI don't know if you guys are aware (I'm not sure how you'd know this), but I'm actually qualified to teach and lecture English. Yup, whether it's the poetic works of Romantics like [Percy Bysshe Shelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley) (who wrote my favorite poem, [Ozymandias](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias) and was married to [Mary Shelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley), author of [Frankenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein)) or the dour narratives of authors like [Aldous Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley), I can tell you all about that...but not today.\n\nNaturally, that's more the literary side of English. Then there's the language aspect to consider. Now something you may or may not know is the **9 Parts of Speech**. They are:\n\n> 1. Articles - **a/an** *(indefinite)* and the *(definite)*\n> 2. Interjections - **Wow!**, **Oh!**, **Woah!**, **Yikes!** and so on\n> 3. Prepositions - **at**, **in**, **upon**, **beneath**, **within**, **outside**, **on top** and so on\n> 4. Conjunctions - **so**, **because**, **then**, **yet**, **but**, **and**, **or** and so on\n> 5. Adverbs - **longingly**, **quickly**, **eagerly**, **lazily** and so on\n> 6. Verbs - **dodge**, **dip**, **duck**, **dive**, and...[**dodge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ASBsQfXnw)\n> 7. Adjectives - **coarse**, **strong**, **red**, **terrific** and so on\n> 8. Pronouns - **he**, **they**, **she**, **him**, **it**, **them** and so on\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ehltRi2.gif)\n\n> Patches O'Houlihan knows his stuff!\n\nSo what's the last Part of Speech you ask? Why, it's the big kahuna of the English language (and maybe every language for that matter). The subject, the object, the idea, the place...\n\n## Nouns\n\nThere are many, many nouns in the English language, but something tells me that in the not-too-distant future, [Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/), 'an experimental attempt to improve the formation of on-chain avatar communities,' may one day dwarf this number if what they say is indeed factual. In many respects, Nouns builds on the model established by legendary NFT project [Cryptopunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) in that it attempts to bootstrap identity, community, governance and a treasury that can be accessed and used by the community itself.\n\nSo how does it all work? Well, here's a rundown of the mechanics that underpin Nouns:\n\n- All Nouns artwork is in the public domain\n- One (1) Noun is trustlessly auctioned forever on an indefinite basis\n- 100% of the proceeds from Nouns auctions are trustlessly sent to the Nouns DAO treasury\n- Once an auction has been settled, the next begins immediately\n- Every single Noun is a member of Nouns DAO\n- The Nouns DAO uses a fork of [Compound Governance](https://compound.finance/governance)\n- 1 Noun = 1 Vote\n- The treasury is controlled exclusively by Nouns via governance\n- The artwork is generative and stored directly on-chain rather than [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)\n- There are *no explicit rules* for attribute scarcity, all Nouns are equally rare\n- 'Nounders' receive rewards in the form of Nouns (10% of supply for the first 5 years)\n\nWith regards to the creation of Nouns, they are generated randomly based on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) block hashes. No 'if' statements or any other rules serve to govern Noun scarcity, meaning that all Nouns are equally rare. At time of writing, Nouns are generated from 2 different backgrounds, 30 different body types, 137 accessories, 234 distinct heads, and 21 different kinds of glasses.\n\n> If you would like to experiment with off-chain Noun generation, you may do so via the [Nouns Playground](https://nouns.wtf/playground)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aggg7cG.png)\n\n### Nouns DAO\n\nThe Nouns DAO makes of a fork of Compound Governance and functions as the main means by which governance occurs within the Nouns ecosystem. As aforementioned, 100% of all ETH proceeds from daily Noun auctions go directly towards the Nouns DAO treasury. Each and every Noun is a permanent member of Nouns DAO and is therefore entitled to one vote in all matters concerning governance. Noun votes cannot be transferred, meaning that if a Noun is sold, the vote goes long with it. However, they can be delegated, meaning that your vote can be assigned to someone else as long as you retain ownership of your Noun.\n\nOf course you must be wondering what a Noun looks like up close (unless you've seen one before of course). Fear not, here's a few Nouns I generated using the Noun Playground:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iD8KHw4.png)\n\n> This colorful trashcan is inclusive and open-minded...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Y8RXASC.png)\n\n> Strawberry, meet Moon. Oh, and don't forget your life jacket!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RlFZ7vD.png)\n\n> 0_0\n\n## On-Chain Artwork\n\nAll Nouns are stored directly on the Ethereum Blockchain and do not make use of pointers to other networks such as IPFS. The reason for this is because Noun parts are compressed and stored on-chain through the use of a custom run-length encoding (RLE) which is a kind of lossless compression.\n\nThe compressed parts are efficiently converted into a single base64 encoded SVG image on-chain. To achieve this, each individual part is decoded into an intermediate format before being converted into a series of SVG rects using batched, on-chain string concatenation. Upon generating the entire SVG, it is subsequently base64 encoded.\n\nIf you didn't really understand that, don't worry...all you need to know is that Nouns are all unique and stored directly on Ethereum.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pWV3yV4.gif)\n\n## Nounder's Reward\n\n'Nounders' consists of the ten builders that brought Nouns to life. Herewith their Twitter tags:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0HSfzTI.png)\n\nSince all the funds received from Noun auctions go towards the Nouns DAO, the Nounders decided to compensate themselves with Nouns. Every tenth Noun for the first five years of the project (Nouns designated #0, #10, #20, #30 and so on) will be automatically sent to the Nounder's multisig so that they may be vested and shared among the founding members of the project.\n\n> An important note: Nounder distributions don't interfere with the cadence of 24 hour auctions. Again, Nouns are sent directly to the Nounder's multisig, and auctions continue according to schedule with the next available Noun ID.\n\n## SharkDAO\n\n[SharkDAO](https://sharkdao.community/) actually started out as a group of strangers from the internet that wanted to pool their resources together and acquire Nouns. Since the DAO began on August 9th 2021, SharkDao has acquired a total of 5 Nouns, brought together over 400 sharks and raised close to 1,000 ETH. As their official website states, they exist to 'evolve the Web3 ecosystem.'\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Sf1aOMa.png)\n\n> The Basics of how SharkDAO works\n\nYou can learn more about becoming a member of SharkDAO by joining their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/8aThDGXHqH) and following them on [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/sharkdao)\n\n## Proper Nouns\n\nAs you can tell, Nouns is a serious project that is here for the long haul. Feel free to follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nounsdao) and join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/nouns) so that you can stay informed regarding the project's progress and get to know the wider Nouns community a little better!\n\nThat wraps up this Discovery of the Day.

      "body": "***Greetings intrepid Blockchain fans! How's it going? You know what time it is...that's right, it's another killer Discovery of the Day! MSQ just moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can sign up for a profile and start exploring all the site has to offer right now! From Monday to Friday we bring you some of the best projects from across the cryptosphere. Whethere it's NFTs, DeFi or Blockchain games, you'll find it all right here! Today we take a quack, I mean quick gander (haha) at a project known as...Cosmic Labs!***\n\n## Animals in Space\n\nFruit flies, apes, dogs, tortoises, frogs, spiders, fish, tardigrades (water bears) and nematodes. No, I'm not talking about NFT projects. These are just some of the living animals and organisms that have been in (and survived) outer space. Well I mean, not actually *in* outer space without a craft or suit, but...you get the idea. The first animal to orbit the Earth was a little dog named Laika, a part-Samoyed terrier found as a stray in Moscow in the then Soviet Union. Vladimir Yazdovsky, head of the Soviet space mission, said that Laika was 'quiet and charming.'\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/I4iUXyP.jpg)\n\nOther animals followed in Laika's famous paw prints, arguably the most notable of which was Ham, a chimpanzee who, on January 31st 1961, flew a suborbital flight on the Mercury-Redstone 2 mission, part of the US space program's Project Mercury. Now one kind of animal I don't see part of the list, or anywhere in the records for that matter, is ducks. Of course there's [Duck Dodgers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Dodgers_in_the_24%C2%BDth_Century) in the twenty-fourth-and-a-half Century, but in terms of actual, quacking, swimming ducks. Well...nothing.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/A7wIIyB.jpg)\n\nThankfully one NFT project is taking the necessary steps to ensure that every duck gets its day...\n\n## Quacking Across the Cosmos\n\nIn the far-off galaxies of Lux and Omnia live some hi-tech, super sweet ducks specially designed by [Cosmic Labs.](https://cosmic-labs.io/#/) So how exactly do these ducks survive in such an inhospitable part of space? Well, some say it's ultra efficient spacecraft while others claims its specialized duck suits. Whatever the case, one thing is for certain: these ducks are totally awesome and expertly designed by a clearly talented artist!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mBag9Z2.gif)\n\n> 'Houston we uhhhhh have a canard here and he uhhhh wants some bread'\n\nCosmic Labs is an NFT brand working to build a series of NFT collections that will live in the Metaverse. Each NFT collection will experience a halving in supply, meaning they will become scarcer, and therefore rarer, as they release.\n\nCurrently, Cosmic Labs has released two different collections thus far:\n\n* [**Cosmic Genesis**](https://cosmic-labs.io/#/CosmicGenesis) - 1,000 Supply (Omnia Galaxy)\n* [**Cosmic Ducks**](https://cosmic-labs.io/#/CosmicDucks) - 8,000 Supply (Lux Galaxy)\n\nCosmic Labs is overseen by a team of extremely skilled individuals ready to take on the many challenges of the NFT space and ensure that Cosmic Labs is a highly sustainable and viable project for many years to come. The creator of these delightful ducks is Meaghan Doherty.\n\nThese ducks as well as all future collections will form part of a larger Cosmic Labs Metaverse. As such, the team will be buying a plot of land in [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/) and releasing a VX collection of Ducks that can be used in the Cosmic Labs Metaverse. That's pretty darn nifty if I do say so myself.\n\nAs an added benefit, every Cosmic NFT will produce $Cosmic tokens every single day. $Cosmic serves as a utility token that fuels the Cosmic Ecosystem. Genesis Ducks will earn 280 Tokens on initial mint and 20 tokens each day they are staked. Similarly, Cosmic Ducks produce 5 $Cosmic Tokens per day which can then be redeemed in the Cosmic Ecosystem.\n\nNow without further ado, let's take a gander at these charming duckies! 🦆\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/H3ovuuJ.gif)\n\n> Genesis Duck #449\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IG3D68I.png)\n\n> Cosmic Duck #6838\n\n## Roadmaps: The Final Frontier\n\nCosmic Labs has an exciting journey ahead of them (on a side note, their Roadmap looks super awesome). The team has many items included such as Breeding, Merchandise, Sandbox Land, Future Collections and more. Check out the full Roadmap below! 👇\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hJEnoMG.gif)\n\nThat's not all though. If you want to find out more details regarding exactly what Cosmic Labs has in store, then check out their [Roadmap page](https://cosmic-labs.io/#/Roadmap) on their official website.\n\nYou can also check out this really helpful FAQ provided by Cosmic Labs themselves:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SpNombK.png)\n\n## Cosmic Labs Stats\n\nThe Cosmic Genesis and Cosmic Ducks collections are sold out, but you can still get yourself one or more of these utterly adorable Ducks over on the Cosmic Labs [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/cosmiclabs) page. And now for some stats...\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\n\n* **Total Items** - 9K\n* **Owners** - 3.3K\n\nI don't know about you, but looking at the way this project works and the amount of care put into all the details, I'm certain that Cosmic Labs is a totally legit project.

      "body": "***Today, we at MSQ are proud to bring you the Ultimate Guide to Parallel! This Guide will provide you with an overview of the project, its many interconnected aspects and some of its more important core mechanics. Of course we'll also be sure to cover the lore behind Parallel as well as some of the lesser-known aspects of this extremely popular NFT-based card game. So without further delay, let's dive headfirst into the immersive world of Parallel!***\n\n## Parallel Lore\n\nTo truly understand [Parallel](https://parallel.life/) in all its glory, we're going to have to go *way* back to where it all began. The story takes place on Earth in the distant future. The planet is utterly depleted and no longer capable of supporting human life, or any life for that matter. As a direct consequence, those who remain find themselves trapped in a desperate struggle for energy and resources. Unable to find any other practical answers, the tattered remnants of humanity attempted to unlock the solution to their woes by hastily experimenting with anti-matter. Needless to say, the consequences were nothing short of devastating...\n\nFive Parallels now find themselves embroiled in a brutal conflict, the victors of which will gain the rights to control what remains of Earth. This is essentially where our story begins. As a participant in the Parallel universe, you will help determine which faction will triumph over their opponents.\n\nChoose the future of humanity. Choose your Parallel!\n\nThe five Parallels are as follows:\n\n* [Earthen](https://parallel.life/parallels/earthen/)\n* [Marcolian](https://parallel.life/parallels/marcolian/)\n* [Augencore](https://parallel.life/parallels/augencore/)\n* [Kathari](https://parallel.life/parallels/kathari/)\n* [The Shroud](https://parallel.life/parallels/the-shroud/)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jc0IB4A.png)\n\n> The Five Parallels *(from left to right):* Earthen, Marcolian, Augencore, Kathari and The Shroud\n\nSo what role do these Parallels play in the game? Simply put, a deck can only consist of cards from *one* Parallel as well as 'Universal cards' which do not belong to any one Parallel and can be used in all decks.\n\nAs an example, you cannot have both Kathari and Marcolian cards in the same deck. However, you can play Marcolian with Universal and Kathari with Universal in two *different* decks. As you can well imagine, each of the Parallels has its own unique strengths and tactical advantages in the game.\n\n## Parallel\n\nParallel is a Sci-Fi online and mobile card game powered by Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain. Every card is a digital collectible (NFT) that can be used to build decks and challenge others in the upcoming game. The game itself has been in development since mid-2021, and though there is no set-in-stone release date at time of writing, the team plan to launch the game sometime in 2022.\n\nThe game is already vast and there's a ton to cover—we'd be here all day if we had to cover every single aspect, so we'll keep to the basics and provide you with a brief overview of how the game will work. To play and participate in the game, you will need to collect a minimum set of cards to create a playable deck that is associated with one of the five Parallels. You are allowed to create more than one deck and play as any one of the five Parallels for each match. Mixing and matching cards from the same Parallel will inevitably lead to the creation of more effective and powerful decks.\n\nA deck consists of 40 cards. In order to win against your opponent, you will need to whittle their Life down to zero (0). At present, each player starts with 30 Life. No deck may contain more than three (3) identical cards with the exception of Legendary cards that are limited to one (1). With this in mind, Let's briefly outline the types of cards you'll encounter and how they'll work in the game:\n\n* **Units** - Creatures, constructs, and beings of all types that can occupy the board and be used in battles\n* **Relics** - Non-combat permanents that can occupy the board and have varying effects, namely *persistent*, *activated*, or *temporary*\n* **Effects** - One-time spells that do something and are then wasted\n* **Upgrades** - Persistent increases, buffs, or other effects that attach to a Unit on the battlefield\n* **Paragons** - A Unit set aside at the beginning of the game that offers a persistent passive effect to your deck\n\nPlaying cards cost Mana, but what happens when you run out? This is where the 'Energy Bank' concept comes into play—you will be able to play your cards face down into your resource pool known as a *Power Bank*. Doing so will not only increase your Mana but allow you to draw an extra card at the end of your turn.\n\nOf course there's many more components to the game, but as aforementioned, we'd be here all day were we to run through all the details. Now that you have a basic understanding of the game's mechanics, it's time to level-up and move on to our next section that covers Cards, Assets and ParaSets.\n\n## Cards, Assets & ParaSets\n\nAs mentioned above, to participate in the game, you're going to have to build a deck composed of several different cards. In this section we're going to cover everything crucial regarding Parallel Cards as well as Assets and ParaSets.\n\n### Cards\n\nParallel Cards are the most important aspect of Parallel since, well, you need them to actually play the game! Before we jump into the types and rarities of cards, let's take a closer look at a card and break it down so we can really understand the significance of the information it contains. Refer below to the image of a randomly selected card and each component that's highlighted:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XNWKHji.png)\n\nParallel cards have seven (7) different rarities. In order to determine a card's rarity, simply note the colored horizontal line near the bottom of the card as well as the color of the QR code. In the image below, you can easily identify which colors correlate with each rarity. One minor thing to note is that each card has both a day and night version. For example, the card above has 3,000 editions—however 1,500 of them are day while the other 1,500 are night. This is something to take stock of when browsing cards on secondary markets such as [OpenSea](https://opensea.i).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6AJDdbY.png)\n\nThe Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary and Prime cards are pretty much your typical rarity traits. However, what is Special Edition [SE]? And what does Perfect Loop [PL] mean? Oh, and we've yet to mention Masterpiece Cards! Let's explore these in a little more detail, shall we?\n\n**Special Edition [SE]** cards are collector edition cards with very small fixed edition sizes. You will be able to tell when you're playing with or against an [SE] card in the game (think foil cards in physical card games).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uEQSbbh.png)\n\n> Singularity Steward [SE]\n\n**Perfect Loop [PL]** cards are animated cards that, you guessed it—perfectly loop! There's not much else to say about these except for 'Look at this awesome animated card!'\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NSRWu0R.gif)\n\n> EMP Shockwave [PL]\n\n**Masterpiece** cards are special 1/1 cards that showcase the stunning art of each card in the game. Masterpiece cards differ visually from the normal cards you will encounter in the game. Those players who hold Masterpiece cards and have them in their wallet on the last day of the month will receive quarterly rewards apportioned directly to them. To read more about Masterpiece cards, take a look at this official [Parallel article](https://medium.com/parallel-life/parallel-masterpieces-25d27a946e09) covering them in greater detail.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0CsxPb3.jpg)\n\n> Orbital Strike 1/1 Masterpiece\n\n### ParaSets\n\nNow that you're comfortable with the different card types, let's talk about what sets you can create with your cards—ParaSets. It's actually pretty self-explanatory: Parallel + Set = ParaSet. Nice job if you worked it out before me!\n\nThe images below showcase various ParaSets you can create with the cards you obtain via Pack Drops or the secondary market. After completing a ParaSet you will be rewarded with an asset (we'll cover these in a moment). Take for instance those who completed ParaSets from Pack Drop 1—they were rewarded with Galaxy Keys for their diligence and loyalty to Parallel.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/J902cLS.jpg)\n\n> Pack Drop 1 ParaSets\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/y4iSNzF.jpg)\n\n> Pack Drop 2 ParaSets\n\n### Assets\n\nNow onto the final part of this section where we tie everything together: What is an Asset? In short, Assets are special NFTs you can obtain by completing a ParaSet. For example, like we mentioned above, those who completed a ParaSet from PD1 were rewarded with a Galaxy Key. Of course there's much more to explore here, so let's find out more about the other assets that exist in the Parallel universe.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nXURnlW.jpg)\n\n> Here you can see the five Assets that currently exist within Parallel: Galaxy Keys, Overclock Keys, 'The Core,' Prime Keys and Catalyst Drives\n\nBoth Galaxy & Overclock Keys could be obtained by completing PD1/PD2 ParaSets. Prime Keys were given out to early supporters of the project—the Catalyst Drive cannot function without a Prime Key. In essence, a Prime Key must be combined with a Catalyst Drive to create a Prime Drive. Finally, 'The Core' could be obtained in Pack Drop 2, but if you missed this, worry not! More will be up for grabs in the next Pack Drop.\n\nSo the question that comes to mind is, *'Well, what exactly do these assets do?'* All will be revealed in the highly anticipated Prime Proposal which we'll cover now.\n\n## The Prime Proposal\n\nThe Prime Proposal will be released to the community in the near future. But...what is it? The Prime Proposal is a whitepaper that discusses the Parallel Ecosystem in detail and outlines everything regarding the game and its economics including $PRIME which will serve as the Parallel Ecosystem's native token.\n\nSo remember all those assets I mentioned earlier? The Prime Proposal will cover their purpose and answer any burning questions you may have. It will literally cover everything you need to know about Parallel! The Prime Proposal is now out of legal review, so here's hoping that it releases soon so that we can all quench our collective thirst and find out even more about this epic game!\n\n## How to Participate in Pack Drops\n\nThe beautiful thing about Parallel is that there are no gas wars! Sounds too good to be true, doesn't it? Nope! Up to this point, Parallel has carried out two Pack Drops (on in July and the other in October 2021), and they plan to carry out the next one at some point in January 2022.\n\nThe way Pack Drops work is by reserving the amount of packs you'd like to purchase. At present you are only allowed to reserve a maximum of three (3) of each pack. However, you may find this tricky given the limited supply! If you're fortunate enough to be able to reserve your packs, there is no payment required until 24 hours after your reservation. It's just magical!\n\nPack Drops consist of 3 types of packs, namely *Core*, *Enhanced* and *Premium*. The images below displays the number of cards you will receive per pack as well as the possible cards you could have obtained in each pack in the recent October Drop. As we get closer to January 2022, more details regarding Pack Drop 3 should become available.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4pCmhdy.png)\n\n> - **Core Pack** - 0.01 ETH (4 Cards)\n> - **Enhanced Pack** - 0.1 ETH (3 Cards)\n> - **Premium Pack** - 0.2 ETH (1 Card)\n\nHow do I participate in a card drop? I'm glad you asked! Follow these three easy steps and you'll be just fine:\n\n1. Locate the reservation page (this will be tweeted out and announced in Parallel's [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/parallelalpha) at the time of the Pack Drop)\n2. Use the drop down buttons to select the quantity of each pack you'd like to reserve\n3. Click 'Reserve'\n\nBoom. Easy as that! Remember, after clicking Reserve, you have 24 hours to complete payment.\n\nNow all that's left to do after paying for your packs is to open them and see what sweet cards you've received!\n\nTo prepare for the next Pack Drop coming in January 2022, make sure you sign up for a [Parallel.life](https://parallel.life/) account and have a Metamask (or other Web3 wallet) set up and ready to go so that you're prepared well in advance to make your reservation!\n\n## Tying It All Up\n\nAs you can clearly see, Parallel is a unique digital card game experience. Much of this is as a result of the technology upon which it's based, namely Blockchain. By providing players with full ownership over their cards and allowing them to trade and compete with one another according to their own approaches, Parallel is changing the way gaming communities function. Moreover, its original lore and mechanics makes Parallel a highly immersive and compelling NFT-based gaming experience.\n\nIn case you don't already, make sure you follow Parallel on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ParallelNFT) and join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/parallelalpha) so that you can find out about the latest developments and drops before the rest of the world does!\n\nAnd that's it for this Ultimate Guide to Parallel courtesy of your friends here at MSQ.

      "slug": "house-of-warlords-honor-blood-sacrifice-and-nfts",
      "body": "***Greetings and welcome to yet another amazing Discovery of the Day! From Monday to Friday we bring you some of our top picks from across the wide world of Blockchain projects: DeFi, NFTs, Blockchain games, Wallets, the Metaverse and more await you right here on MSQ, the New Homepage for the Decentralized Web! Today we take a closer look at a project that has Honor and Virtue at its core. It's House of Warlords!***\n\n## Rise of the Samurai\n\nWhen the [Kamakura Shogunate,](https://dbpedia.org/page/Kamakura_shogunate) a hereditary military dictatorship, was established in 1185 AD, all real political power in Japan was placed in the hands of the samurai. Around the same time, Zen Buddhism was introduced by China into Japan. Consequently, many samurai identified strongly with this philosophy as it propagated the idea that finding salvation and inner peace is only possible through thoughtful introspection and meditation.\n\nAt the same time, the sword gained great significance in samurai culture. Many held the belief that a man's honor lay within the craftsmanship and strength of his blade—carefully hammered and sharpened edges, inlays elegantly embedded with fine metals and the creation of intricate sharkskin handgrips became the standard for any serious samurai warrior.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WeGdNrj.jpg)\n\n> Noble samurai warriors had great respect for their weapons\n\nDespite their decorum and chivalry, it is also true that the samurai were no strangers to war and death. Many of their rituals and practices were suitably gruesome, the most notable of which is almost certainly [*seppuku*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku), otherwise known as *Harakiri*. This was a ritual form of suicide by means of disembowelment with one's own sword.\n\nIn certain instances seppuku was performed voluntarily by samurai so that they could die with honor instead of falling into the clutches of their enemies (who would likely torture them to death). It was also used as a form of capital punishment for samurai who had been found guilty of serious transgressions. Finally, samurais performed seppuku because they had brought shame upon themselves and could only restore their honor through this one final act of self-sacrifice...\n\n## The Ballad of the Spleen Flower\n\n> When the universe was first conceived, it was no different from a human embryo, possessing all the same parts and organs as an infant. In order to protect these parts, the universe built gigantic fortresses as big as galaxies. However, one part, a tiny, delicate spleen, was left unprotected. Despite its fragility, it could not be contained.\n>\n> The spleen is a repulsive flower that occupies no definite time or space within existence. If it appears, it is for a mere eight seconds before it vanishes once more. One day, in the jungles of Hokkaido, the spleen appeared, right before a hungry tiger was about to devour a toad. The awful stench reminded the tiger of its favorite kind of catch: the boar. Just before the eight second limit was hit and the spleen disappeared, the tiger managed to bite a small chunk out of it.\n>\n> This led to a catastrophic event called the *Haipa Taimurifuto* in which the past fused with the present thanks to the formation of an interdimensional time-rift. It also led to the transfiguration of humans with yokai. Since the spleen flower was damaged, it could no longer regulate the balance between good and evil, and so all hell broke loose...\n>\n> Soon thereafter, governments and any kind of order collapsed. Two opposing factions rose up out of the ashes and battled against one another in a brutal struggle for supremacy. But all was not well within the factions themselves. Indeed, mistrust, deceit and betrayal were all-too rife, and so 'Houses' formed from these two larger factions. Since Haipa Taimurifuto occurred, bloodshed and sacrifice is all the world knows...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SrrwfQo.png)\n\n[House of Warlords](https://houseofwarlords.com/) (HOWL) is a next-gen NFT PFP project featuring totally original tattoo-inspired art and some seriously hardcore tech. The collection consists of 8,888 entirely unique programmatically generated NFTs fighting for their honor on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. Some of its features include:\n\n- On-chain properties\n- Ultrasound deflation\n- Composability tech\n- Tokenomics\n- Over 1,000 hand-drawn traits\n\nSounds pretty exciting, right? That's because it is. If the Lore wasn't proof enough, House of Warlords mechanics should serve as evidence of its originality and innovative approach to NFTs. HOWL really pushes the boundaries of innovation not only through its deflationary mechanism, but having on-chain properties which means you actually own the traits of your warlord! Read more about this [here](https://medium.com/house-of-warlords/house-of-warlords-pfp-2-0-loot-inspired-on-chain-properties-51c9a9280615) and why its important!\n\nAnd that's not all! Take a look at the below graphic and you'll see there's a whole lot going on in HOWL.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fms2hS6.png)\n\n### The Great Seppuku Event\n\nThis deflationary event occurs on a monthly basis within the HOWL Ecosystem. By committing Seppuku, one of your Warlords will need to be burned. This will provide you with 1,000 SOUL tokens as well as a 50/50 chance to claim a new NFT as well as the ability to **select** and **transfer** traits from one Warlord to another, thus increasing your rarity. Now that really is pretty hardcore!\n\nOh, if you are lucky enough to be able to claim a new Warlord NFT, you'll discover these new Warlords are from a brand new House with an even lower supply! To find out more about the Great Seppuku, visit HOWL's [mechanics](https://houseofwarlords.com/mechanics) page.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BYwlOd8.png)\n\n> It's bloody, but it ensures your honor is upheld...\n\n### $OUL tokens\n\nA HOWL holder earns $OUL tokens from the Great Seppuku Event or via Conquests (Staking). These tokens may be used to purchase gears for Warlords as well as 1/1 limited edition artworks, merch or even live experience at the $OUL Collector. Again, to find out more about $OUL tokens, please visit HOWL's [mechanics](https://houseofwarlords.com/mechanics) page.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bdIx3RA.png)\n\n> He's just sleeping, I promise\n\n### The Warlords\n\nAnd what do the Warlords themselves actually look like? That's a great question. Let's take a look at a few of these amazing NFTs:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0J8qyM9.png)\n\n> Declan was always averse to smiling for school photos\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dh5DoSi.png)\n\n> Taking a page out of [Vlad the Impaler's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler) book I see?\n\n## A Map of Sacrifice\n\nA project as complex and original as House of Warlords has a surprisingly straightforward (but no less fantastic) Roadmap. Just check out some of the milestones HOWL has listed below.

      "body": "_**Welcome back to yet another unforgettable Discovery of the Day! MSQ is the New Homepage for the Decentralized Web, so we have everything from DeFi and NFTs to Blockchain Games and Wallets for you to check out. From Monday to Friday, we bring you some of our top picks from across the cryptosphere and serve it up to you in the most fun and entertaining way possible! Today we're proud to feature...Doodles!**_\n\n## Zip-a-dee-Doodle-dah\n\nWhat do you get when you take talent, professional experience, and outrageously fun artwork and cross it with a massive and dedicated community? Easy—you get [Doodles,](https://doodles.app) a project that stands as a shining example of everything an NFT project could ever hope to be.\n\nInitially launched on October 17th, 2021, Doodles is a collection of 10,000 NFTs built transparently on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) and stored securely via [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) that will undeniably make you FOMO hard.\n\nI'm genuinely devastated that I slept so long on this project, and after learning even more about the Doodles team and how this project is run, turning them into a _Discovery of the Day_ was simply unavoidable. As I always say, 'give credit where it's due,' and in this case, Doodles rightfully deserves the spotlight. Read on to find out why I'm such a fan...\n\n<div style=\"width: 83%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/dkQhvQF/doodles.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n## Rarities & Traits\n\nDoodles are created from 265 unique traits using a [provably fair](https://docs.doodles.app/provable-fairness) generation mechanism. This basically means a verifiable 'no shady business' guarantee when it comes to who mints what. Now this is particularly welcomed if you've ever aped into a project only to later discover allegations of rarity/mint/ownership manipulation, which is sadly [all too common](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits) in the crypto and NFT space.\n\n> For our more technically inclined readers, you can learn more about Provenance Hashes, an essential component of the Doodles minting process, and how they work [here](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-elegance-of-the-nft-provenance-hash-solution-823b39f99473)\n\nAs for Doodles traits themselves, you can view an exhaustive list of all available attributes in the _[Traits & Rarities](https://docs.doodles.app/traits-rarities)_ documentation or scope some of the rarest traits below:\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ToSnNqx.png)\n\n<div style=\"width: 83%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Fq4m5rx/doodles-rare.gif)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n<b>Rare Doodles</b>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n    \n</div>\n\n## Transparent and Secure\n\nAs a dev and security geek, I can't do an article about Doodles and _not_ bring up how impressed I am by how transparent and secure this project is. On top of offering full-fledged [Doodles Documentation](https://docs.doodles.app), they not only list the [Doodles Contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8a90cab2b38dba80c64b7734e58ee1db38b8992e) **and** all associated ETH addresses, but they also use [Gnosis Safe,](https://gnosis-safe.io) a multisignature smart-contract protocol, to secure the Doodles Contract and Community Treasury.\n\nIn simpler terms, all signers must approve contract changes, and if one person's wallet is compromised, the Doodles contract and NFTs are safu.\n\n<div style=\"width: 75%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://media0.giphy.com/media/DURbX7oesHiaA/giphy.gif)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n<b></3</b>\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Oa31e6O.png)\n\nIt should be noted that shadier projects often go out of their way to obscure information like this, so when I see this level of transparency and security, it gives me the warm & fuzzies 🥰\n\n## The Doodle Bank\n\n[The Doodlebank](https://forum.doodles.app/t/doodlebank-v0-1-vision-guidelines) is the Doodle community's treasury and is used to scale the team and experiment with growing the Doodles brand. At the time of writing, there is over 650 ETH in Doodlebank. This effectively gives Doodle holders the ability to participate in governance decisions over the direction and future of the Doodles project.\n\n<div style=\"width: 70%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business4/uploads/doodles1/original/1X/4f076c9668f180583ef6b1be2ba78e9d24cc6ff6.jpeg)\n\n</div>\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThe Roadmap for Doodles is collaborative and decided upon by Doodle holders via the [Community Treasury](https://docs.doodles.app/community-treasury). Initially seeded with 420 ETH (nice!), the Community Treasury allows holders to vote for experiences, activations, and campaigns that benefit Doodles. With imaginative ideas, adequate resources, and coordination, Doodles has the potential to spread throughout the vertical of Popular Culture.\n\n![](twitter:byburnttoast/status/1465098235551395842)\n\n## The Team\n\nThe Doodles team is equally impressive, with prior clientele running the gamut from [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com) to [Google](https://about.google) and even [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com) and [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co). Needless to say, the Doodles team are no slouches:\n\n| <div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto; clip-path: Circle();\">![](https://doodles.app/images/burnt-toast.png)</div><br>Scott Martin<br>[@byburnttoast](https://twitter.com/byburnttoast) | <div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto; clip-path: Circle();\">![](https://doodles.app/images/tulip.png)</div><br>Evan Keast<br>[@evankeast](https://twitter.com/evankeast) | <div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto; clip-path: Circle();\">![](https://doodles.app/images/poopie.png)</div><br>Jordan Castro<br>[@Poopie_cat](https://twitter.com/Poopie_cat) |\n| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n| A Canadian-based illustrator, designer, animator and muralist.

MSQ just moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can sign up for a profile and start exploring all the site has to offer right now! From Monday to Friday we bring you some of the best projects from across the cryptosphere. Whether it's NFTs, DeFi or Blockchain games, you'll find it all right here! Today we bring you a project featuring NFTs that respond to your actions! It's...the dudes!***\n\n## thedude\n\nThe world of NFTs has been nothing short of a godsend for countless talented artists, allowing them to pursue their lifelong dreams and showcase their artistic abilities to audiences across the world...\n\nBut what about all the exceptionally talented programmers?\n\nWell, today we're excited to share a story about an incredibly gifted programmer who goes by the name of [thedude](https://twitter.com/thedudesnft) with you. Now this person is responsible for creating completely code generated NFT profile picture collections with ***'No designer, just code.'*** Wild, right?\n\nThus far, thedude has created several PFP collections using his creative approach: [the dudes](https://opensea.io/collection/thedudes), [the duds](https://opensea.io/collection/theduds), [the abstract dudes](https://opensea.io/collection/the-abstract-dudes) and [the dudes factory](https://opensea.io/collection/the-dudes-factory).\n\nAll of this has been created by one person (yup, thedude) who has been coding interactive web apps since he was 15! So it seems he's always had a knack for this stuff, and it's very clear that he's...one busy dude!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nE2JWoK.gif)\n\n> When in doubt...just play it cool\n\n### the dudes, the duds & the abstract duds\n\n[the dudes](https://opensea.io/collection/thedudes) is the first interactive fully code generated NFT collection to appear on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. In essence, the dudes is the genesis collection of the overall project. And don't forget—no designer worked on this...it's nothing more than a few lines of code that generates random ugly dudes (they're not ugly actually, they're kinda sweet and endearing!)\n\nAll traits are assigned inside the smart contract itself while each rarity score is defined on the chain. There are a total of 21,600 unique dudes, but only 512 will ever be made available to claim. That...isn't a whole lot. If anything, that means the dudes are extremely rare, so owning one really is something special!\n\nWhen I first saw these guys, I couldn't believe they were the random product of some algorithm! It's quite bizarre to say the least, and of course, very impressive as well! Feast your eyes on some of these 'ugly' dudes below *(also, can we have a word count for how many times I've mentioned the word 'dude' in this article!?)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fU3HRbk.png)\n\n> the dudes\n\nNext up we have ['the duds.'](https://opensea.io/collection/theduds) Now these guys were airdropped by the creator of 'the dudes.' The intriguing part about this collection is that they slowly reveal themselves as time passes. After 07/28/2022, they will show their faces fully. Take a look at their current state below 👀\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GfFxqYv.png)\n\n> the duds\n\nAnd finally we have ['the abstract dudes'](https://opensea.io/collection/the-abstract-dudes) which are derivatives of the original ['the dudes'](https://opensea.io/collection/thedudes) and well...it's in the name! They look super abstract! The original 'the dudes' smart contract was used to create these pieces. This collection served as the proof of concept that revealed the potential possibilities of harnessing the dudes' DNA.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6tEIDCm.png)\n\n> the abstract dudes\n\nOne aspect that makes this project truly special is that every single NFT is interactive. If you visit the dudes' [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/thedudes) page, you can click on any dude to 'agitate' it, or you can move your mouse around and watch its gaze follow your cursor. Now that's some really funky stuff!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TWrelYb.gif)\n\n### the pixels\n\nNow let's move on to thedude's latest endeavor: the pixels. This collection consists of 5,120 'the pixels' that live on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain. A unique element of the pixels is that they constantly change and evolve—this is possible because the traits are embedded into the smart contract, allowing it to delegate other contracts to manipulate each pixel.\n\nThe contract has a feature enabled called 'the pixel inc,' granting the NFTs the ability to adopt different traits for special occasions such as Halloween and Christmas. I swear, each project made by thedude just gets cooler and cooler! Kudos for the totally genius innovation...whoever you are!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kw1vnVD.gif)\n\n> the pixels\n\n### the dudes DAO\n\nWe've established that the dudes are awesome, but do you want to know something that's even *more* awesome? Everyone who owns one of these NFTs from any one of these collections is part of something bigger: **'our dudes DAO.'**\n\n100% of all existing royalties are owned by the DAO. Its primary role is a simple one—to encourage the growth of the dudes brand and project as a whole.\n\n> A decentralized autonomous organization is an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government.\n\n## the dudes roadmap\n\nthe dudes project is actually split into two separate roadmaps: the Dude development roadmap, and the Community development roadmap.\n\nThe Dude roadmap focuses on airdrops, collaborations with other projects, staking and more. You can view the collaborations that the dudes have engaged in so far via [the dudes factory](https://opensea.io/collection/the-dudes-factory)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QRnekpt.png)\n\n> 'Our dude development roadmap is centered around delivering project value to our holders...'\n\nNow the Community roadmap is a little different—simply put, the DAO votes on suggestions provided by the community via the shared Trello board, which can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/invite/b/SilI1mJf/3017d49963aeb65364dd8a81d42442d2/dude-owners-community-board)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oh9bSY6.png)\n\n## the dudes statistics\n\nUnfortunately all of the collections we have showcased today are sold out 😭 But not to worry! You can still grab yourself one of these unique interactive NFTs on the dudes' various OpenSea pages:\n\n* [the dudes](https://opensea.io/collection/thedudes)\n* [the duds](https://opensea.io/collection/theduds)\n* [the abstract dudes](https://opensea.io/collection/the-abstract-dudes)\n* [the pixels](https://opensea.io/collection/the-pixels-inc)\n\nI don't know about you, but the innovation within this project and the pure creative genius thedude possesses is seriously phenomenal! I'm intrigued to learn more and see what thedude ends up creating in the future! I highly recommend you follow the dudes over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thedudesnft) and join their [Discord](https://discord.gg/wM7HSMDV4B) so that you can keep up to date with all the latest details and collections being released by thedude!\n\nAnd that brings us to the conclusion of yet another seriously wicked MSQ Discovery of the Day! If you haven't signed up for a profile yet, make sure you do so as soon as possible so that you never miss a thing. And don't forget to tell all your friends and family to sign up too! Thanks for your time and enthusiasm, it means the world to us!

      "body": "***People of MSQ! We're back with another exciting and totally new Discovery of the Day! From Monday to Friday we bring you some of our top picks from the world of crypto. Whether it's DeFi, Blockchain games, NFTs or the Metaverse, we cover it all right here on MSQ! In today's edition, we answer the question, 'What would happen if cute animals decided to become mecha pilots?' This...is A.N.I.M.O!***\n\n## The...Mechaverse? Wait...\n\nGundam, Voltron, Titanfall, Megas XLR, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Pacific Rim...no matter where you look, mechas and giant robots are pretty much everywhere. Why? Well, I think the answer's obvious—they're totally awesome! One could argue that the idea for colossal mechas dates all the way back to the time of the Ancient Greeks. Created by Hephaestus at the behest of Zeus, [Talos,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talos) a giant automaton made entirely of bronze, would circle the shores of the island of Crete in order to protect [Europa,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(consort_of_Zeus)) a consort of Zeus, from invaders, pirates and bandits.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YzhISUr.gif)\n\n> Unfortunately for Jason, oxidation did little to dampen Talos' fighting spirit...\n\nNow obviously Talos is by no means a mecha or a robot, merely an automaton, so some of you might consider this example a bit of a stretch. Now more recently, in Popular Culture, Mitseru Yokoyama's [Tetsujun 28-go,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetsujin_28-go) released in 1956, is widely considered to be the first real series within the mecha genre. In terms of its plot, the series' 12-year-old protagonist, Shotaro Kaneda, uses a remote to control a giant robot that was constructed as part of a last-ditch effort to win World War II by the Japanese military. This narrative resonated well with a great many people and led to the creation of countless derivatives and imitators. Incredible!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3asK83t.jpg)\n\n> Giant mechas in World War II...can you dig it?\n\n## Autonomous Nugget in Mech, OK?\n\nYes, that's what the acronym [A.N.I.M.O](https://animo.art/) stands for! Combining cute with crushing, A.N.I.M.O is an upcoming generative NFT project featuring 10k animal mechas on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. Each A.N.I.M.O consists of several different interlocking parts, namely Pilot, Top, Legs, Front, Attachments and Paint Job. When an A.N.I.M.O is minted, all parts are included and combined to generate an entirely unique animal mecha...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/z02pbnD.gif)\n\n> I don't think this guy could ever get bored (Get it? It's a warthog...never mind)\n\nSo 10,000 A.N.I.M.O. units will be created and distributed as follows:\n\n- **9,500** available to all users\n- **200** for giveaways and free mints to eligible owners of the qualified collections\n- **300** shared among team members\n\nThen with regards to available rarities, this is what the team behind A.N.I.M.O currently has in mind:\n\n- **D** - 4,999 units\n- **C** - 3,000 units\n- **B** - 1,000 units\n- **A** - 600 units\n- **S** - 300 units\n- **S+** - 100 units\n- **Illegal** - 1 unit\n\n*Please note: The above information is merely a draft and is subject to change at any time.*\n\nAs for the A.N.I.M.O units themselves, well...what do they look like? Judging from what the team has posted on the A.N.I.M.O [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AnimoNFT) page, you can expect to receive something akin to this when you mint:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MTaYGGP.png)\n\n> Never has the prospect of imminent death been so adorable...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2VLp6vV.jpg)\n\n> After the pond was drained, Freddy decided to get his own back\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MeJs1fX.png)\n\nFeeling bullish or spiderish? Why not both?\n\nFYI, A.N.I.M.O will feature some special 1/1s within the collection. Freddy the Frog up there? Yup, he's a 1/1...and he looks ready for action! Also, when A.N.I.M.O launches, 12 collaborations with artists are going to be auctioned! Now that's some exciting stuff!\n\n## Intel on Whitelist\n\nSo if you want to know more about getting on the whitelist for A.N.I.M.O, the first thing you need to take into account is that it will be available on their [official website.](https://animo.art/) Interested parties will need to connect their wallet using the [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) extension within any browser that supports it. They will also need to log in to the A.N.I.M.O website using [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AnimoNFT) or join the A.N.I.M.O [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/animo) and solve a captcha.\n\nOnce a party has connected their wallet and logged in, they will be able to whitelist their wallet address accordingly. A minting quantity between 1 and 3 will then be randomly assigned to whitelisted addresses. When actual minting occurs, the party will be able to mint the amount assigned to them or just 1 if they prefer. At the time of writing, the mint price of A.N.I.M.O units is set at 0.088 ETH.\n\n*Please note: The above information is subject to change at any time.*\n\n![](twitter:AnimoNFT/status/1467206364908949510)\n\n> This is one of the earliest proof of concepts the team put together using a few parts and some different pilots\n\n### The Team\n\nThe A.N.I.M.O team consists of a few seasoned developers with about 50 years in combined experience. If you want to know where these devs have worked at or with in the past, well, names include (but are not limited to) Warner Bros, Activision, Epic Games, Wargaming and more! The core team is comprised of [MechNuggets,](https://twitter.com/MechNuggets) [Tooty,](https://twitter.com/tootsaloots) [MagicTrashBag.eth,](https://twitter.com/Magictrashbag) and [Joyal.](https://twitter.com/joyal_hg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Mdh5Vze.png)\n\n## What's Next for the Mechas?\n\nAside from the actual whitelisting and mint itself, A.N.I.M.O has a lot in store. Although no formal Roadmap exists at this point, collaborations with artists, free mints and even games and toys are all being seriously considered, so be on the lookout!\n\n- For more information on A.N.I.M.O, please visit their [FAQ](https://animo.art/faq)\n- For more details regarding artist collaborations, visit the A.N.I.M.O [Collaborations Page](https://animo.art/collaborations)\n\nI don't know about you, but given the proven track record of this highly capable team and the sheer awesomeness of these cute little mechas, I have little doubt that A.N.I.M.O is a project you're going to want to follow closely. Make sure that you follow this super fun NFT project on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AnimoNFT) and join the A.N.I.M.O [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/animo) to get to know the community and find out all the latest info before anyone else does!\n\n![](twitter:AnimoNFT/status/1444357281571868672)\n\nThe idea of animals controlling all kinds of different mechas is a bit offbeat, but that's what makes A.N.I.M.O such a unique and charming project.

MSQ just moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can sign up for a profile and start exploring all the site has to offer right now! From Monday to Friday we bring you some of the best projects from across the cryptosphere. Whether it's NFTs, DeFi or Blockchain games, you'll find it all right here! Today we bring you something truly heroic...It's MetaHero Universe!***\n\n## Superheroe (and Villains) in the Metaverse!\n\n> A superhero (or superheroine) is a stock character that possesses superpowers, special abilities beyond those of ordinary people, and fits the role of a hero, typically using his or her powers to help make the world a better place...\n\nWho comes to mind when you read the above paragraph? Spider-Man? Batman? Maybe Superman? There's certainly a lot to choose from, and I'm sure you have a certain hero (or heroes) who resonate with you on one or more levels. Superheroes, villains, giant green bulldozers produced from gamma radiation (I'm looking at you, Hulk)—they have all played a major role in countless thrilling experiences and lifelong memories for audiences and fans across the world.\n\nWhether it's reading the comics, watching the epic blockbuster movies or imagining your own scenarios while playing with the action figures, superheroes and their evil-doing counterparts have become an intrinsic part of Popular Culture. But what about the Metaverse? We can't have a Metaverse without superheroes now, can we? Well my friends, there's no need to fear, because MetaHeroes is here!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4V06QBq.gif)\n\n> *Faster than a lightning transaction...it's Meta Man!*\n\n## A Universe for the Ruthless and the Just\n\n[The MetaHero Universe](https://punkscomic.com/planetdao.html) is comprised of nine planets and one moon to be owned and governed by their respective planetary DAOs. It aims to be a social gaming platform that will allow its community members to actively build, own and govern the Universe via these DAOs. In terms of the narrative, the Universe will feature a storyline that constantly evolves through Pixel Vault's genesis project, PUNKS Comic (we'll get into this soon!) Simply put, the comic will serve as a creative vehicle for the MetaHero Universe.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SFxBAAQ.jpg)\n\n> In case your astrology isn't up to par, the nine (9) planets of the MetaHero Universe are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto!\n\nEach planet will possess its own unique interactive environment, providing revenue opportunities to the community-governed DAOs and players via land-based sales, environmental resources, wearables, gameplay, and more. At present, planet minting is paused until further notice. Be sure to check regularly for updates on when this will resume.\n\nThe creator of the soon-to-be sprawling MetaHero Metaverse is none other than [Pixel Vault,](https://twitter.com/pixelvault_) a media group focused on elevating crypto-native assets across a variety of mediums through the development of intellectual property empowered by decentralization (yeah I know, that was a bit of a mouthful!)\n\n### PUNKS Comic\n\nSo earlier I briefly mentioned PUNKS Comic, which serves as the genesis collection of the entire project. It tells the crazy story of Beanie and his ordeal as he endures kidnappings, clowns, anons, and the mysterious Elvis Punksley during his quest for some of the most enigmatic relics of cryptoart history...\n\n***'Watch the story unfold as the 16 punks hunt for the Lost Robbies'***\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0aJhZbj.jpg)\n\n> PUNKS Comic, Issue #1\n\n### MetaHero Generative Identities\n\nMetaHero Generative Identities is a collection of Hero, Villain and Mutant identity NFTs inspired by the 16 main characters that appear in PUNKS Comic. There will be up to 9,824 MetaHeroes that will be created from a variety of traits. In order to have gotten your hands on one of these guys (or gals), you would have had to have held a mint pass, and to have gotten your hands on a mint pass, you would have had to have held a comic!\n\nAll minted MetaHero characters are due to appear in a MetaHero Universe game that should be released at some point in the future. Now, let's take a closer look at some of these volatile villains, merciless mutants and, of course, honorable heroes!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cHQgFRc.png)\n\n> MetaHero #904\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R30VHFW.png)\n\n> MetaHero #3092\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/djSYV5h.png)\n\n> MetaHero #1317\n\n## What Awaits Our Heroes!?\n\nThe MetaHero Universe Roadmap is huge and the Pixel Vault team has a lot planned for the future. To view the full Roadmap in all its glory, you can check out the [blog post](https://metavault.substack.com/p/sprint) that was recently released. However, for your convenience, here's a quick summary of all the major items that are forthcoming (or at least on the cards...)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BNAm22z.png)\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg though! Needless to say, I can't wait to see all of this come to fruition!\n\n## MetaHero Universe Super Stats!\n\nThe PUNKS Comic NFTs and MetaHeroes are sold out, but you can still get yourself one or more of these over on their respective OpenSea pages: \n\n- [MetaHero Universe: Generative Identities](https://opensea.io/collection/metahero-generative)\n- [PUNKS Comic](https://opensea.io/collection/punks-comic)\n\nAnd now it's time to crunch some numbers...\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\n\n### MetaHero Universe: Generative Identities\n\n* **Total Items** - 5.9K\n* **Owners** - 1.4K\n\n### PUNKS Comic\n\n* **Total Items** - 9.3K\n* **Owners** - 3.2K\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tb8OVq5.png)\n\nWith such awesome art and so much planned, it's hard to ignore a project like MetaHeroes Universe, which is exactly why you shouldn't!

From Monday to Friday, we bring you some of our top picks from across the world of Blockchain—DeFi protocols, NFT projects, Blockchain games, and more can be found right here on MSQ! So what's on the menu today? Is it Hardly Hares? Scarcely Scarecrows? Nope, it's Barely Bears!**_\n\n## Just Grin and Bear It\n\nBears—they're not exactly a favorite among serious crypto enthusiasts, and for good reason. Having said this, they're still pretty impressive (and dangerous) creatures. Now the vast majority of bears are found in about 60 countries, most of which are in the Northern Hemisphere and confined to North America, Europe, and Asia. There are Brown Bears, Kodiak Bears, Black Bears, Spectacled Bears, Sun Bears, Panda Bears, and even Polar Bears. They are extremely powerful creatures which, if not given the proper respect and caution, can be a major hazard to anyone who encounters them.\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TNTYkrR.gif)\n\n</div>\n\nOf course, bears are also featured in many stories and are very much a part of Popular Culture. From Rupert to Paddington and Winnie the Pooh to The Berenstain Bears, humans have anthropomorphized and romanticized these rather territorial creatures into relatable companions that doubtlessly occupy special places in many people's childhood memories. And naturally, there are teddy bears of all shapes and sizes that make people from all walks of life feel a sense of comfort and familiarity.\n\n<div style=\"width: 80%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ca4dvnl.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nIt's not the first time we've mentioned bears here on MSQ, and no, we aren't talking about the kind that FUD the market. While there are several NFT projects using bears as their signature animal, only a select few measure up to what today's Discovery of the Day has to offer. So without further delay, let's get to it!\n\n## Smarter Than the Average Bear\n\n[Barely Bears](https://barelybears.io) is a multi-part series of hand-drawn NFT Ursidae on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) Blockchain that are *paws*-itively loaded with personality and hilarious cultural references. And as you'll soon see, there's plenty to love about this project purely based on looks alone. I'm pretty sure you'll find a piece that speaks to you.\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/pdHxJPX/barely-bears.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n> You can also learn more about Barely Bears by visiting their [MSQ page](https://MSQ.io/projects/barely-bears)\n\nMade up of an international team with members in the UK and Israel, Barely Bears focuses intensely on organic growth and community empowerment—the polar opposite of what you tend to see in a lot of projects out there. One of the most deceptively simple ways in which users are given control is via airdropped referral coins to Genesis 'OG' collection holders, which effectively represents spots on the 10K mint-list, something I'm not sure I've ever seen before.\n\nThese referral coins can be sent to your friend, your grandma, your favorite NFT influencer; you can run your own Twitter/Reddit/Insta giveaway; they can be sold on the secondary market; they can be burned; or they can be used to mint additional bears from the 10K collection. Now that's what I call utility!\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/GJ1xTrP/referral-coin.gif)\n\n</div>\n\n## The Genesis 'OG' Collection\n\nThe Barely Bears Genesis 'OG' collection is comprised of 111 NFTs featuring unique 1/1s and a series of special and holiday-themed airdrops. I hate to be the bearer (ba-dum-tss!) of bad news, but we're currently on **Bear #108**. Yup, the Genesis collection is nearly complete! The good news is that it's not too late to take part in the many contests and giveaways for the remaining Bears. It also means the 10K collection will be launching sooner rather than later, so that's definitely a plus!\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/CVddkHH/og-drops.gif)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\nGenesis Holder Airdrops\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 105%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pB1Wn3z.png)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\nRarity—it's all about the bear necessities\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n## The 10K Collection\n\nThe much anticipated 10K collection launches this month (soon™️) and features over 400 hand-drawn traits. All Genesis 1/1 and airdropped Bears holders will be among the first to mint from the 10K collection and are allowed two mints, with 1/1 Genesis holders also being granted one free (+gas) mint. The mint price will be 0.05 ETH plus gas with holders receiving full IP rights. As for the public sale, a limit of 10 mints per wallet will be put into effect.\n\nThe 10K collection mint will be divided into three separate sales to avoid gas wars and will take place as follows:\n\n- 72 hr Genesis 'OG' free (+gas) mint\n- 72 hr Whitelist & Contest Winner mint\n- 10K Public Mint\n\n## 'Tokenomics & Staking & Breeding, Oh My!'\n\nThat's right, Dorothy! These Bears don't sleep when it comes to utility; all Bears holders receive a number of exciting benefits. While still under development, Phase III offers a lot to look forward to and builds heavily off the prior Genesis and 10K collections.\n\nIf you hold either two 10K Bears or one 10K Bear plus one Genesis Bear, you'll be given access to breeding cards that will allow you to breed your very own bears. There are also plans to offer tokenomics mechanisms that let you passively earn tokens that can be redeemed for breeding cards and will provide further utility down the road.\n\nAnd that's not all, folks! There are even plans to extend staking and DAO functionality that will allow Bears holders to participate in project governance. Now that's what I call high *koala*-ty community offerings!\n\n<div style=\"width: 105%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RQomwIn.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\n## Outside the Cave\n\n**Bearly Bears on the [YungShow](https://twitter.com/YungShow)**:\n\n![](youtube:faScRzhA7HY)\n\n**Barely Bears x Dead Freaks**:\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/PwKMxkV/BBxDF.jpg)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\nThat's right!

      "body": "***Hello and welcome to a very special Discovery of the Day! MSQ recently moved into its Open Beta, so for the first time, users can sign up for a profile and explore what the site has to offer without having to jump through any fiery hoops. From Monday to Friday you can check out our Discovery of the Day articles that feature some of our top picks from the realms of DeFi, NFTs, Blockchain-based games and more. Today we take a look at a project that is taking an amazing idea to the next level. Without further ado, let's dive deeper into...Wizards & Dragons Game!***\n\n## The NFT Game That Cried Wolf\n\nSo unless you've been living under a rock, around two weeks ago, a fairly new NFT-based game called [Wolf Game](https://wolf.game) ran into a spot of bother. Now the concept behind the game is simple enough—when minting an NFT, players receive either a Wolf or a Sheep. However, the caveat is that there is only a 10% chance of minting a Wolf. Sheep generate the in-game currency $WOOL, but Wolves receive 30% in tax on all generated $WOOL in return for leaving Sheep alone. Without getting into too much detail on the game's finer aspects, despite its relatively simple mechanics, *Wolf Game* turned out to be a major hit with both Sheep and Wolves selling for several ETH on the secondary market.\n\nHowever, the spot of bother came about as a result of the game's design. Now if you know anything about coding, it's that creating a bug-free program is basically impossible. *Wolf Game* built everything into the Ethereum Blockchain, and this, as you can imagine, was a serious oversight. Once something is integrated into a Blockchain, and once an NFT has been minted, it cannot be changed. Sure enough, a bug was discovered in *Wolf Game's* code that could result in a possible exploit. Due to the game's architecture, the developer cannot patch the code and is now engaged in the process of migrating NFTs. In other words, the game is being completely recreated and new tokens are being issued, this negating the original NFTs.\n\n> You can find out more about the issue encountered by *Wolf Game* in this [TechRaptor article](https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolf-game-highlights-challenges-of-nft-game-development) by Robert N. Adams\n\nWhile *Wolf Game's* model is indeed a brilliant one, its approach was a misguided one. Oftentimes being first to market means that you have to bear the brunt of the consequences since you may not have anyone else to base your work off of or consult with for advice or pointers. Having said this, *Wolf Games'* developer did publicly disclose the bug as well as a third-party audit of the code and the introduction of a bug bounty system to ensure that this issue never occurs again.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GL9OblR.gif)\n\n> Don't worry son, we'll have them Wolves and Sheeps migrated lickety split!\n\n## Learning From Others' Mistakes (And Your Own?)\n\nNothing quite like vaulting ambition, right? Well, if Aesop's fable of the [Tortoise and the Hare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare) is anything to go by, it's that slow and steady does often win the race. Now instead of rushing in like a fox in a hen house (or a wolf in a barn full of sheep), the devs behind [Wizards & Dragons Game](https://wnd.game) took a look at what *Wolf Game* was trying to achieve and wanted desperately to address the problems it had encountered. Having reviewed some threads on Twitter regarding exploits, the initial idea was to simply lock read functions during writes and solve the problem that way. Easy, right?\n\nWrong! The team, confident with their fixes, subsequently offered a bug bounty to anyone who could break the code before they went live with mints. Needless to say, within 20 minutes, three bugs had already been discovered. Soon thereafter, another more significant issue was discovered. $200,000 in bounty payments and several changes later, the team were able to redeploy because, unlike *Wolf Game*, the WnD team had split out the game contract from the collection, giving them the ability to redeploy as and when they desired.\n\nOh but it doesn't end there. About 7,400 addresses were then added to the contract using a gassy approach, costing around 25 ETH! Now that's quite the fee! Then the game started, and someone managed to mint 4 Dragons in a row! Yikes! Minting was paused, a review was conducted and an approach known as 'commit+reveal' was instituted. 4 hours later, minting was unpaused.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bWebfOL.gif)\n\n> If you want to read more about the exact details of the above process, check out the original [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/wndgame/status/1468492094041821185?s=20) posted by **@wndgame**\n\n## Here There Be Wizards (and Dragons)\n\nLook, the above information was shared by the developers themselves. Why? Simply because transparency and honesty matters, especially in a space like crypto that's rife with Machiavellian tactics, scams and rugpulls. While *Wizards & Dragons Game* may not be the OG, and while it did suffer from some teething problems (which project doesn't?), if it had taken a less careful approach, well...the project may have ended all together. Yeah this is conjecture, but it's not a possible outcome that's easily dismissed, and I'm sure the devs themselves would agree with me.\n\n*Wizards & Dragons Game* combines DeFi mechanics with collectible utility-focused NFTs in a unique strategic gaming experience that is 100% on-chain. There are several new game mechanics within *Wizards & Dragons,* namely:\n\n- Treasure Chests\n- Tributes, and\n- Sacrifices\n\nThe idea is to create lasting value by developing a fun community-driven game that is fully playable on-chain through the magic of NFTs within a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocol. At time of writing, *Wolf Game* and several forks are unplayable due to the exploits affecting them. This is why *Wizards & Dragons* has developed some watertight fixes for all known vulnerabilities affecting the open source *Wolf Game* contracts, and yes, this does include Flashbots bundle protection. As such, the smart contracts will be verified on [Etherscan.](https://etherscan.io/)\n\nAll metadata and pixel art related to *Wizards & Dragons Game* are fully generated and stored on a permanent basis on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. Since Wizards & Dragons is released in the public domain, the game may be used in virtually any way in which a player or developer wants.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8mpnHaK.png)\n\n## The Path to Redemption\n\nOK, so I guess you could call this the *Wizards & Dragons Game* Roadmap if you like. In essence it's divided into three interrelated parts called 'Acts,' and right now, we're on *Act I: Wizards & Dragons!* Anyway, let me not divulge all the details. Take a look at the graphic we prepared just for you:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aUla8be.png)\n\n> If you would like to find out more about The Path of Redemption (The *Wizards & Dragons* Roadmap), you can view it in its original form on this [Medium post](https://medium.com/@wndgame/wizards-dragons-guard-the-tower-in-a-100-on-chain-strategy-game-a29597f5bfc9)\n\n## The Inner Workings of Wizards & Dragons\n\nRight, so you already have a decent idea of how *Wolf Game* works, so you can imagine that *Wizards & Dragons Game* works much the same. Let's break it down:\n\n### Wizards\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0bE1HlJ.png)\n\n> 'I awaken. My first thought is of the tower, and my duty...I begin my shift. I !guard. The day is long, but I know my purpose...my mission. I will !guard. For it is all I have ever known...'\n\nSo Wizards guard the Tower and earn GP, the game's currency:\n\n- **Minting** - Wizards are the most common character type. Much like Sheep in *Wolf Game,* They have a 90% chance of being minted\n- **Staking** - Wizards earn 12,000 GP per day from guarding the tower\n- **Claiming** - The Wizards have an ancient deal with the Dragons to stay away from Wizards guarding the tower. In exchange, the dragons collect 20% of the wizards’ claimed GP (this is lower than *Wolf Game's* 30%)\n- **Unstaking** - Leaving the tower is a dangerous proposition. Wizards can leave the tower if they have accumulated 2 days worth of GP earnings necessary to survive the journey. So what's the catch? Well, there's a 50% chance that all accumulated GP will be stolen by Dragons (coin toss anyone?) The same Wizard that was initially staked must be unstaked\n\n### Dragons\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4dzycKq.png)\n\nNow Dragons collect GP from Wizards and steal mints from other players! Gasp! These scaly beasts receive a rank between 5 and 8 when they are minted— the higher the rank, the higher the proportion of GP and stolen mints. For example:\n\n> **Dragon A** has a Rank of 8 while **Dragon B** has a Rank of 6, and they are staked:\n> \n> - If 70,000 GP total has been accumulated as taxes, **Dragon A** will be able to claim 40,000 GP while **Dragon B** will be able to claim 30,000 GP\n> - If a newly minted Wizard or Dragon is stolen, **Dragon A** has a 57% chance of receiving it while **Dragon B** has a 43% chance of receiving it\n\n- **Minting** - Dragons are rare. Like Wolves in *Wolf Game,* they have a 10% chance of being minted\n- **Staking** - Dragons earn 20% of the GP produced by staked Wizards. They also have a chance to poach newly minted Wizards or Dragons\n- **Claiming** - Dragons collect 100% of earned GP\n- **Unstaking** - Again, Dragons collect 100% of earned GP\n\n### GP Token\n\nGold Pieces (GP) is an ERC-20 token that serves as the primary in-game currency for *Wizards & Dragons*. GP allows players to mint Wizards, Dragons, and other valuable assets for the game. As you've probably already ascertained, GP is earned by staking Wizards and Dragons. The supply of GP is capped at 6 billion.\n\n### Treasure Chests\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hlzlEs5.png)\n\nGP can be stored in Treasure Chests, a kind of ERC-1155 token. At time of writing, the price is 25,000 GP. Treasure chests can be offered as insurance to stop Dragons from stealing players' mints. Dragons will accept the bribe 50% of the time.\n\n- **Without treasure chest** - 10% chance of Dragons stealing a non-genesis mint\n- **With treasure chest** - 5% chance of Dragons stealing a non-genesis mint as well as a 5% chance of Dragons stealing a treasure chest\n\n### Tribute\n\nPlayers can pay tribute by throwing GP into 'The Pit.' If The Tower is satisfied with their patronage, a mysterious looking item, rumored to be crucial to the prosperity of the Tower in Acts II and III, will be granted to the player. However, there is a limited number of mysterious looking items. Once the supply cap for each item has been reached, no more can be obtained...\n\n**Recipes:**\n\n- **1x current GP mint price** = Air Rune (Supply - 1550)\n- **2x current GP mint price** = Earth Rune (Supply - 800)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/H7lwXXy.png)\n\n### Sacrifice\n\nThe path to salvation is trying, and at times, much must be given in order to attain it. Players may choose to sacrifice a Wizard or Dragon on the sacred altar. The Tower will recognize their absolute and unwavering faith. In return, an exceedingly scarce and mysterious looking item, said to be paramount in leading and controlling the pace of PvP battles in Acts II and III, will be granted unto them. Again, there is a limited number of mysterious looking items. Once the supply cap for each item has been reached, no more will be available...\n\n**Recipes:**\n\n- **3x current GP mint price + Wizard** = Water Rune (Supply - 550)\n- **4x current GP mint price + Dragon** = Fire Rune (Supply - 100)\n\n> For more information on Minting and to view all the details about Wizards & Dragons Game, please refer to this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@wndgame/wizards-dragons-guard-the-tower-in-a-100-on-chain-strategy-game-a29597f5bfc9)\n\n## A Sorcerer's Stats\n\nSo there's a whole lot to unpack with *Wizards & Dragons Game*, but it's pretty clear that, despite having only been around for a short while, it's proving to be very popular. Just take a look at the details below...\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n![](twitter:wndgame/status/1468670090526797824)\n  \n</div>\n\nIf you missed out on minting, you can always pick up a Wizard or Dragon over on the project's [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/wizards-dragons-game-v2) page.

MSQ just moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can sign up for a profile and start exploring all the site has to offer right now! From Monday to Friday we bring you some of the best projects from across the cryptosphere. Whether it’s NFTs, DeFi or Blockchain games, you’ll find it all right here on MSQ! Today we bring you something bitter, hot and delicious that goes by the name of...Crypto Baristas!***\n\n## Not Just Your Average (Cup of) Joe\n\nCoffee—the dark, aromatic, slightly acidic beverage that gives us a much-needed boost in the morning was introduced to the world all the way back in the 15th century. A strong coffee gives you the energy you need to get your work done (or stay up all night gaming)—it's a truly glorious drink that most of us probably couldn't go a day without. In today's day and age, cafés and coffee shops, with their calming atmosphere, delicious food and all-encompassing smell of fresh coffee, are a favorite meeting place for millions of people around the world!\n\nIn fact, coffee is so ubiquitous that it's even found its way into the ever-evolving world of Blockchain technology! Are you surprised? Well, you shouldn't be. At this point, if you can dream it, it can almost certainly be made into some kind of token or asset. So get yourself a cup and get ready, because this project is going places, and fast!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3M7DgVL.gif)\n\n> A double shot of espresso there [Mr. Dangerfield?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Dangerfield)\n\n[Crypto Baristas](https://cryptobaristas.com/) consists of hand-drawn characters whose purchase helps back the world's first NFT-funded café in New York City. The charming design of Crypto Baristas is the result of [Tony Bui's](https://twitter.com/tonybuifanclub) expertly executed work while the project itself was created and is managed by [Coffee Bros](https://coffeebros.com/), which is operated by Dan and Nick. They are a New York City-based coffee roastery that focuses on sustainability, building stronger ties with local communities, and strengthening the economies and ecosystems of the countries from which their products originate.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Tq7fvRY.png)\n\n> *The goal of Crypto Baristas is to build a community of like-minded individuals who appreciate art, caffeine, entrepreneurship, and innovation* - Dan Hunnewell\n\nIt is the hope that, through Crypto Baristas, the team will be able to open a physical space in NYC where art and innovation is the focus. The future of Crypto Baristas beyond that will be up to the holders and followers of their campaign, because *'In the world of Crypto Baristas, everyone matters.'*\n\nCrypto Baristas is, at the time of writing, in the midst of Season 1, which consists of just 60 characters. These characters are split up into 3 different rarities, namely **Barista, Master Barista** and **World Barista Champ.** The higher the rarity level, the rarer the traits!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dU6WgCF.png)\n\nOne of the best things about owning a Crypto Barista is that it gives holders plenty of utility. The team truly believes that its holders should have a say in the future of the project. For this reason, owning one or more Crypto Baristas confers voting rights to each and every holder. There's more though—owning a Barista comes with Caffeine Perks, access to the Barista Bank & Early Access to Season 2! You can find out what each of these aspects means below:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HtybWpM.png)\n\n> 'Some potential uses for the Barista Bank may include providing support to charitable organizations in the coffee space, advancing the Crypto Baristas project, or starting something completely new...'\n\nNow we've done enough talking about Crypto Baristas, so let's quench our thirst and show you some of these Blockchain-based Baristas right now!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dafKDrh.png)\n\n> Barista\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fuExx3B.png)\n\n> Master Barista\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cie4hiX.png)\n\n> World Barista Champ\n\n## Follow the Trail of Coffee Beans\n\nCrypto Baristas is brewing some pretty cool stuff and have plenty planned for the future. This includes launching awesome-looking merchandise, continuing to release Season 1, initial café concepts and much more!

From Monday to Friday we bring you some of the best projects the cryptosphere has to offer. From NFTs and DeFi to Blockchain games and the Metaverse, you’ll find it all right here on MSQ! Today we explore the role of photography in the NFT space and showcase the work of some of the photographers already contributing their talents to it!***\n\n## A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words...\n\nIn fact, when it comes to some NFTs, a picture is worth several thousand dollars (or even more!) Over the past 12 months we've seen the NFT space explode in popularity and dominate feeds across numerous social media sites. This has given many creatives the opportunity to pursue their lifelong dreams of becoming full-time artists and showcase their artistic abilities to thousands of people across the world. You may have heard of Mike Winkelmann (AKA [Beeple](https://twitter.com/beeple)) who sold the most expensive NFT art piece to date at a whopping $69 million on February 21st, 2021. This was a monumental moment for the NFT industry and catapulted it into the global phenomenon it has become.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/he33UT6.jpg)\n\n> ['Everydays: the First 5000 Days'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everydays:_the_First_5000_Days) is a collage of 5,000 digital images created by Winkelmann as part of his 'Everydays' series\n\nMany creatives realized that they could earn an income or even life-changing money through limited art collections and generative projects. Just a few months after Beeple's record-breaking sale, there are countless NFT projects that are either well into their Roadmap or just starting out. The vast majority of projects seem to consist of 2D/3D drawings or renderings, animated pictures and unique 1/1s. However, a medium that we here at MSQ haven't really looked into yet is a time-honored one practiced by thousands of people around the world...yup, I'm talking about photography!\n\nLike other creatives, one of the main issues photographers face is copyright! Yes indeed, image theft is a real thing—but what if there was a way to prove a photo was yours, hard evidence that no one could contest? Well my friends, that evidence can be found and permanently stored on a Blockchain!\n\nAnd what is the underlying technology of NFTs? Yup, it's Blockchain! A Blockchain allows digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. In this way, it serves as the foundation for immutable ledgers—records of transactions that cannot be altered, deleted, or destroyed. By using a Blockchain, nobody will be able to steal or misuse the images captured by photographers (or any other creative) ever again!\n\nAnother issue faced by creatives is being able to make a living through their art. With such a saturated market, it's very difficult for them to generate enough income from the sales they make. Thankfully NFTs have opened new doorways for artists and photographers and allowed buyers to obtain scarce digital assets and prove that they truly own them.\n\n## Value in a Snapshot!\n\nLet's start off by taking a look at [Where My Vans Go](https://opensea.io/collection/where-my-vans-go), a limited NFT collection that consists of 115 iconic images created over the span of three years. Each image depicts different beautifully captured locations from across the United States and an individual sporting different pairs of [Vans.](https://www.vans.com/) Purchasing one of these limited edition NFT photographs not only supports the artist but also means that buyers own the piece in its entirety since the image exists on a Blockchain, meaning that ownership can be verified at any given time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pXXG0XR.png)\n\n> **Heart In The Sky** by Isaac Wright\n\nWe're not the only ones who think photography has huge potential in the NFT space—just check out what [GaryVee](https://twitter.com/garyvee) said in a recent [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWGNfMUgQMZ/) post:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Cd1tSxS.png)\n\n## Photographers Inside the NFT Space\n\nAlthough it's still early in the amalgam that is photography and NFTs, we've already seen some seriously talented photographers enter the space. Let's take a closer look at some other examples and celebrate these creators for embracing such a revolutionary technology!\n\n### Souls Escape by Ismail Zaidy\n\n[Ismail Zaidy](https://twitter.com/l4artiste) is a visual artist and photographer based in Morocco, North Africa. He has created a striking collection available for viewing on OpenSea called [Souls Escape.](https://opensea.io/collection/soulsescape) These photographs tell the story of young souls seeking to escape from old rituals and bonds in order to define themselves and their future.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XLVqA0Z.png)\n\n> **Souls Escape** #20\n\n### Fac//es by Brittany Pierre\n\n[Brittany Pierre](https://twitter.com/redactedpride) is a serious street and film photographer based in Chicago, Illinois. She is the creator of an NFT collection on OpenSea called [Face//es](https://opensea.io/collection/faces-4) which aims to celebrate Black life and culture in America. The goal of Brittany's street photography is to reveal and share the best of humanity found within her hometown of Chicago. Each image depicts an individual expressing or experiencing joy.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m3Q9SLR.png)\n\n> **Lis//ten**\n\n### Laurel Charleston\n\n[Laurel Charleston](https://twitter.com/YannyCharleston) is actually a makeup artist based in Bushwick, Brooklyn. They are redefining the craft in the Metaverse with their expert art, makeup and photography skills. Laurel is an unbelievably talented artist who recently released their [Genesis Collection](https://foundation.app/@LaurelCharleston) on [Foundation,](https://foundation.app/) so be sure to check it out!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1guh9uF.png)\n\n> **Facial Thermodynamics**\n\n## Developing the Perfect Image\n\nThese talented and innovative photographers demonstrate what can be achieved in the NFT space through the medium of photography. I highly recommend you follow them all on Twitter and check out their NFT collections (linked below) so that you can find out more about their work and get to know them on a more personal basis:\n\n- [**Souls Escape**](https://opensea.io/collection/soulsescape) by [Ismail Zaidy](https://twitter.com/l4artiste)\n- [**Fac//es**](https://opensea.io/collection/faces-4) by [Brittany Pierre](https://twitter.com/redactedpride)\n- [**Stunning Makeup Art Photography (Genesis Collection)**](https://foundation.app/@LaurelCharleston) by [Laurel Charleston](https://twitter.com/YannyCharleston)\n\nAnd that's a wrap for today's feature. What do you think? Will photographers be able to enjoy the same love and attention that other artists have in prior months? Let us know via any of our social media channels!

Crypto presents many opportunities to people, and for many, it will change (or already has changed) their lives for the better. Virtual real estate is an intriguing concept and one that is drawing a great deal of attention and investment. Is this really the future of the internet? Or is it simply another fad?***\n\nAs visions of a popularized metaverse turn from science fiction to reality, virtual real estate has established itself as the next frontier of Web3.\n\nWhen integrated with virtual reality, the premise feels a bit dystopian—that one day we may all wake up, put on our headsets, and exist in a world that is purely digital, each of us with our own avatars and lives separate from the ones we no longer want to live in the meatspace.\n\nThe craziest part may be that this idea is no longer just conceptual. A plot of land in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) sold for $2.4 million in November, and games like [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/) have received hundreds of millions of dollars in investment on the premise that the metaverse is the future of not just gaming, but the internet.\n\nBut what is it about virtual real estate that has such a grip on the Web3 space, and society at large? Can the state of the world be to blame for our desires to escape reality?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bfFbvHe.gif)\n\nPersonally, I would say yes. Between the ongoing pandemic and its new variants, political turmoil around the globe, supply chain stoppages and climate change, there are plenty of reasons to want to live in a world of animal JPEGs and flying avatars.\n\nAlong with a desire to escape reality is, of course, financial incentives. The crypto space has been compared to a gold rush in recent months, and for good reason. There is money to be made here, and lots of it, with virtual real estate being no exception. Whether it's buying land to flip for resale or building utility on top of it for passive income, the space is proving as lucrative as it is perplexing.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/78xxeyj.png)\n\n> Land in The Sandbox is being snaffled up by brands, celebrities and projects\n\nWhen you really think about it, our lives are already very virtual. In the age of the pandemic, many of us wake up and jump onto Slack for eight or nine hours of the day, existing in a virtual world that may not resemble a metaverse, but demands a similar attention. The idea, then, that we would want to make this world fun, filling it with NFTs and gaming, makes sense.\n\nThat’s not to say that what [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), or 'Meta,' is doing with virtual office space is something to look forward to. But it brings up a good question—if we are going to collectively spend all day working on our computers, how can we make it a better experience?\n\nAnd at its core, that question will be the driving force behind our transition from Web2 to Web3. An internet without ownership, like the one we currently have, is less desirable to a growing faction of the world than what Web3 could offer. And as we continue to place more value on our lives in virtual worlds, whether it be our Twitter presences or how much virtual real estate we own, our desires will largely stay the same—ownership of things that provide happiness and a sense of belonging.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/i0DLXkY.gif)",

MSQ recently went into its Open Beta, meaning you can now sign up for a profile and explore the site virtually unrestricted. From Monday to Friday, we bring you some of our top picks from across the world of Blockchain—DeFi protocols, NFT projects, Blockchain games, and more can be found right here on MSQ! Today we're proud to bring you...Non-Fungible Fungi!***\n\n## Fruitful NFTs\n\n[Non-Fungible Fungi](https://thefungi.app) is a kingdom of 10,100 unique 3D animated mushroom NFTs casually shuffling across the damper regions of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) Blockchain. Each Mushroom falls into 1 of 3 species; _Magic_, _Mire-able_, and _Bog Standard_, with _Magic_ being the rarest and _Bog_ being the most common. The _Genesis Mushrooms_ introduces the 'grandfather traits,' providing a multitude of attributes ranging in rarity and looks that constitute the 10,000 Generative collections.\n\n![](youtube:a7tH0NoEsqY)\n\nThe Non-Fungible Fungi project is elaborate, expansive, and focused on longevity, community, and providing a usable and highly desirable NFT for both collectors and backers alike. The Non-Fungible Fungi have been designed from the ground up so that everyone who ends up owning one feels like their NFT is truly one of a kind. Whether you're an experienced crypto collector or someone just starting in NFTs, Non-Fungible Fungi offers something for just about everybody.\n\n## Fungus Amongus\n\nThe 10K Non-Fungible Fungi release is made up of the Genesis and Generative collections, with the Genesis drop consisting of 99 Dutch-style auctions and one standard auction via OpenSea on October 5th and October 6th respectively.\n\nThe Generative Drop was carried out somewhat differently and had a few added mechanics. On October 31st, the Non-Fungible Fungi team began distributing 9,999 mint passes that acted as a ticket to minting a Generative Mushroom:\n\n- **October 31st** - 3,000 Passes Publicly sold via Dutch Auction\n- **October 31st** - 300 Passes given to Genesis holders\n- **November 1st** - 6,699 Passes sold via Whitelist (4 given out via community competitions)\n- **November 22nd** - Generative Collection launches and passes can be minted\n- **November 29th** - 1 Magic Mushroom minted and auctioned on OpenSea for charity\n- **December (TBD)** - Magic Mushroom reveal\n\n### Non-Fungible Fungi Genesis Collection\n\n<div style=\"width: 60%; float: inherit; margin: auto;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/SKW18H0/nff-genesis.gif)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\nNon-Fungible Fungi Genesis - [Fungi #98](https://opensea.io/assets/0x5f47079d0e45d95f5d5167a480b695883c4e47d9/98)\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n<details><summary>Click to expand <b>Genesis Fungi #98's</b> IPFS metadata</summary>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Fungi #98\",\n  \"image\": \"ipfs://QmbJVEWNyqUH9U5DbxBWsFdtuTDRAQf6SjpEQgXjxccr1o/98.mp4\",\n  \"external_url\": \"https://www.thefungi.app/\",\n  \"description\": \"The Non-Fungible Fungi collective is a kingdom of 10,100 unique 3D animated (and enchanted) Mushroom NFTs strolling through the Ethereum blockchain.

      "body": "***Hello and welcome to another Discovery of the Day! MSQ just moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can sign up for a profile, check out the site and leave some reviews on some of your favorite projects! From Monday to Friday we bring you our Discovery of the Day series, articles that take a closer look at our top picks from the realms of NFTs, DeFi protocols, Blockchain games and the Metaverse! Today we explore the work of a particularly talented animator with a penchant for vintage loops...it's Tony Babel!***\n\n## The Origins of Animation\n\nSince time immemorial humanity has attempted to chronicle its path across the ages—primitive renderings line the walls of countless caves while innumerable paintings, frescoes, sculptures and etchings are on display in galleries and museums across the world. A great deal of what we know about our past is contained within static texts and images, and it was only in July of 1877 that [Charles-Émile Reynaud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Reynaud) built and presented the world with the first-ever [Praxinoscope.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxinoscope)\n\nWhile relatively simple in its construction, when spun, the Praxinoscope displays a looped sequence in which a given figure or image could be seen seemingly moving and changing over time. While nothing more than an optical illusion, the Praxinoscope was (and still is) a delight to both adults and children alike.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VMMED7U.gif)\n\n> Slightly different static images + kinetic motion = animation!\n\nReynaud could not possibly have known just how profound his invention would turn out to be. Over the past few decades, the art of animation has changed and shifted, and with the advent of modern technology and automated information processing, animation has become significantly easier to carry out, requiring much less time and energy to render a given sequence.\n\nThis is not to say that animation is easy, but the tools available to artists makes it far more accessible and intuitive, thus providing particularly talented artists with the means to create high-quality pieces of moving art in a fraction of the time it would have taken them in the past. In other words, artists still need to be talented and capable, but they can carry out a lot of the more monotonous work far more rapidly than they could before.\n\n## Tony Babel\n\nI usually try to come up with fun and witty titles for these articles, but with the sheer caliber of artist I'm discussing today, it really isn't necessary. [Tony Babel](https://twitter.com/TonyBabel) isn't some opportunist or fly-by-night charlatan. He's actually been creating fun animated loops for several years now—just take a look at his [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tony.babel/) page and you'll see how his work has changed and progressed over time...and you can be certain that what you see online isn't where his journey began. In fact, Tony has been at this for what I surmise to be 16 years now, honing his craft and style over the course of many, many months. And the results of this tireless dedication to his craft? Well, take a look for yourself:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TonyBabel/status/1469292002768572433\"></a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nAs you can plainly see, Tony's work is nothing short of pure technicolor goodness. What sets him apart from his contemporaries is a combination of elements including sound design, motion, color palette, characters, lighting and composition. At first glance you might think of these animated loops as relatively simplistic, but if you consider all the subtle details, the many individual parts and the timing of interconnected events, the brilliance of Tony's work becomes abundantly clear.\n\nDespite the fact that these animated sequences consist of stylized forms and are often humorous in nature, there is a very evident polish inherent within Tony's creations, and just to the right degree as well—nothing is overproduced or out of place, and every last element feels deliberate, directed and necessary. The animation itself comes across as very organic with little or nothing to suggest that it was rendered using a desktop computer.\n\n## Learn from the Best!\n\nSo just how does this animator from Israel bring his creations to life? Well, the main principle that Tony follows is to 'animate simple shapes first' and then add the important details later. Now this may sound easy enough, but I have no doubt that Tony's summation is something of an oversimplification. Needless to say, animators who are able to master this approach and refine their technique may well get the opportunity to showcase their work to a wider audience in the not-too-distant future...\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TonyBabel/status/1470038329391562755\"></a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n## 'Check, please.'\n\nAs testament to Tony's continued success and rise up the ranks of the NFT world, his most recent work, 'Check, please,' at time of writing, was sold to @artifact for 15.0 ETH in an auction that took place on [SuperRare.](https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/%22check,-please.%22-30771) This is nearly double the 8.0 ETH what was paid by @siinamota for '👀' (yes, that is in fact the title of the work) on [Foundation](https://foundation.app/@tonybabel/~/101110) on October 21st, 2021:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SuperRareBot/status/1465966908335955975\"></a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n**'Check, please'** by Tony Babel\n\n</div>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TonyBabel/status/1466003749730762755\"></a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n'👀' by Tony Babel\n  \n</div>\n\nTony's work is truly remarkable and will undoubtedly go down in history as some of the greatest NFT art ever produced. His creations contain a heap of authentic passion, expert craftsmanship and an unbridled love for the art of animation. If you haven't yet, be sure to follow Tony over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TonyBabel) as well as [Foundation,](https://foundation.app/@tonybabel) [SuperRare,](https://superrare.com/tonybabel) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tony.babel/) and [Showtime.](https://showtime.io/tonybabel) No need to ask why. It's creative forces like Tony that truly bolster the NFT community and demonstrate just what can be achieved with time, dedication and persistent excellence.\n\nAnd that's where today's journey ends!

      "body": "***Greetings everyone and Happy Holidays! MSQ recently moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can sign up for a profile and explore all the site has to offer! From Monday to Friday we bring you some of the best projects the cryptosphere has to offer. From NFTs and DeFi to Blockchain games and the Metaverse, you’ll find it all right here on MSQ! Today we explore an exciting new game title that was recently announced at 'Into The Galaverse'. We present to you...The Walking Dead: Empires!***\n\n## A First Glimpse at The Walking Dead: Empires\n\n*[The Walking Dead: Empires,](https://twdempires.game/)* alongside some other great new titles, was unveiled last weekend at the [Into the Galaverse](https://www.galaverse.games/) crypto and gaming event hosted by [Gala Games](https://app.gala.games/) in Las Vegas. *Into the Galaverse* is a Blockchain Gaming event that features some epic announcements, game releases, NFT drops, and even famous artists like [Maroon 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroon_5) that performed live, much to the delight of convention attendees. A ton of stuff was going on there, but today we're going to focus on the new Walking Dead MMORPG by Gala Games, *[The Walking Dead: Empires.](https://twdempires.game/)* So strap yourselves and have your weapons at the ready, cos this one's gonna be special!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xECPSsz.png)\n\nA recent partnership between Gala Games and [AMC](https://www.amc.com/) brings *The Walking Dead* to Blockchain. How exciting! *The Walking Dead: Empires* is an MMORPG set in *The Walking Dead* Universe, or more specifically the US state of Georgia as seen in the popular TV series.\n\nHowever, the location isn't the only overlap between the TV series and upcoming game. It was revealed that there's going to be up to *30* original characters appearing in the game from the show! We're talking Michonne Hawthorne, Rick Grimes, Glenn Rhee! What a line up! In addition to these characters, the game will include each of their signature weapons including Lucille (Negan's baseball bat), Sasha's sniper rifle, Rick's Colt Python and more!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PMmLFnV.jpg)\n\nBesides the original characters making an appearance, the game will also include some famous landmarks from the show. Since the game is based in Georgia, it’s confirmed that we’ll see locations like Hershel Greene's Farm as well as the infamous Prison. Having said this, the developers are also creating a number of areas that are entirely unique to the game.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SQWJYJS.png)\n\n> The Prison is the main setting for Season 3 as well as the first half of Season 4 in AMC's *The Walking Dead*\n\nOK, OK, so we've covered enough about the content of the game, so let's take some time to dig into its mechanics and what you're actually going to be able to do. Let's take a look...within the game you’ll be able to:\n\n- Craft weapons and fight for survival\n- Defend what’s yours and even take from others in a world where anything goes\n- Construct a base on your land as well as build defenses to keep you safe from walkers and humans alike\n- Invite others to settle on your land and reap the benefits of what they grow and build\n \nEssentially the way the game works is summarized in its title—you build your own Empire within *The Walking Dead* Universe! Now because this is a Blockchain game, Land, NFTs & crypto are all a major part of its DNA, so let's discuss the way Land works now...\n\nThe map will be split-up into ten different regions, each of which will have a city in its center. There's will be a number of fast travel spots that will allow you to instantly hop from one city center to another. Convenient!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/a4FWu10.jpg)\n\n## Land, NFTs & DEAD Coin\n\n### Land\n\nOver the course of the last year, we’ve seen some awesome Blockchain games come to life including Blankos Block Party, Town Star, War Riders, The Sandbox, and Mirandus. A common mechanic in games like The Sandbox and Mirandus is the ability to purchase LAND, giving users the ability to create and build experiences as well as invite people to their virtual real estate.\n\n*Walking Dead: Empires* is doing something similar. In the game you will be able to develop your land and make it a safe place for others to seek refuge or a juicy target for your enemies to attack. So if you want to build the next Alexandria or Hilltop (like in the TV show), well...you can! Either way, you benefit if your territory becomes a hub for action.\n\nThere are six (6) tiers of rarity—the higher the rarity of the land you own, the bigger it is, meaning it can support more players, house more structures and so on. You’ll earn rewards and improve your land when others buy, sell, fight, or kill on it. To purchase land, you can head over to *The Walking Dead: Empires* [Gala Games](https://app.gala.games/games/the-walking-dead-empires) page! Each piece of land is an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) that gives you complete and true ownership over your real estate.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XwH0EWO.jpg)\n\n### Dead Coin & Play-to-Earn (P2E) Mechanics\n\nDead Coin is the game's primary utility token that will be used when facilitating purchases of items, land, labor and more. *The Walking Dead: Empires* is also going to have a free-to-play mode, allowing anyone to participate and enjoy the Play-to-Earn (P2E) mechanics. Anyone will be able to jump into the game and start earning Dead Coin immediately! There will be markets in the game where Dead Coin serves as the currency for all trades as well as purchases of in-game items and resources. Pretty nifty!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2DLX2Kb.jpg)\n\n## Fight the Dead, Fear the Living!\n\nIt's thrilling to see such popular IP like *The Walking Dead* enter the Blockchain space, and we can only hope that more companies and popular IPs will follow suit (and they almost certainly will). The talented and innovative designers behind *The Walking Dead: Empires* are focused on having the community help build an immersive and visceral experience by listening to any and all feedback received as each segment of the game releases. I highly recommend you follow both [Gala Games](https://app.gala.games/) & [Ember Entertainment](http://ember-entertainment.com/) wherever you're able to in order to stay up-to-date with the latest news and info concerning *The Walking Dead: Empires'* development.\n\nThanks for joining me in today's Discovery of the Day!

      "body": "***Greetings all and welcome back to yet another Discovery of the Day! MSQ recently moved into Open Beta, meaning you can now sign up for a profile and enjoy everything the site has to offer. From Monday to Friday we bring you our top picks from across the cryptosphere as part of our Discovery of the Day series. Today we take a closer look at a project bringing your favorite NFTs into the real world...it's NiftySlabs!***\n\n## Bridging the Gap...\n\nNFTs are awesome, but unless you have access to a computer or some kind of mobile device with an internet connection, it's pretty much impossible to share them with others (unless you right-click, save as, of course). Some might consider this a minor drawback, but there are indeed those persons who wish their NFTs were more...tangible. While it's definitely nice to own things digitally, having some kind of proof of its existence and value in the real world is reassuring.\n\nNow it may not be possible to have every kind of NFT in 'physical' form, but static images and profile pics simply need to be printed out, right? Not quite. Of course you could just print an NFT out on any old printer on just about any kind of paper, but that doesn't exactly seem fitting for something with value, now does it? Imagine someone asking you about your NFT collection and you opening up your actual wallet and pulling out some scrunched up images printed on standard paper. I don't know about you, but that doesn't sound very appealing to me.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fiWsNkf.gif)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n**Pullin' out my NFTs in the real world like...**\n    \n</div>\n\nIf only there was some way to ensure that physical versions of NFTs were expertly handled and fashioned in such a way as to attain optimal levels of quality and durability...if only...\n\n## 'A Slab of a Face?'\n\nSo [NiftySlabs](https://niftyslabs.com/) is a pretty novel and fun way to bring your NFTs into the world of the corporeal. Moreover, the process is simple:\n\n- NiftySlabs will verify that you are, in fact, the owner of the NFT you want to 'slab'\n- A physical 1/1 version of your NFT will then be created complete with personalized traits and information\n\nAnd that's about it really. Naturally there's a little more to this process, and of course the quality of the finished product is what matters most. Take a look at the details:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SlW6Fa6.png)\n\nNope, this ain't no flimsy card or some cheap laminated junk...we're talkin' the real deal here folks! 420gsm (the perfect weight for crypto) cardstock together with all the important info listed on the back? Now that's the way to do it!\n\nOf course it's also really important that the actual print itself is high quality. There's nothing worse than a card or image that appears pallid, lifeless and drab. When it comes to the world of NFTs, we're talking about color, form and energy—nothing less! Thankfully NiftySlabs has this covered as well:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gRXdPlJ.png)\n\nNaturally even the best quality prints and cardstock don't provide sufficient protection from the elements. Fear not! NiftySlabs has given this due consideration, which is why they provide their clients with card slabs (or cases) so that almost nothing can contaminate or taint their precious NFTs. In this way anyone who chooses to have a physical version of their NFT created can keep it in near mint condition and keep it stored safely (or put on display) for years to come.\n\n## Sampling Some Slabs\n\nSo why don't we take a closer look at a few of the NFTs that have been slabbed?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mzXOqSh.png)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n**Monsieur Pepe couldn't stand hand sanitizer**\n\n</div>\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JjXgKEv.png)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n**Mrs. Ape realized she had forgotten her earmuffs**\n    \n</div>\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LyBPvfo.png)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n**In Soviet Russia, NFT print *you***\n    \n</div>\n\nThis is just a handful of the total number of NFTs that have been slabbed so far. If you want to find out more, head over to NiftySlabs' [Slab Archive](https://niftyslabs.com/slabs/) and take a look around.\n\n## The Value of NiftySlabs\n\nSo there's a few things to take into consideration regarding NiftySlabs. They are as follows:\n\n- **Secure Your NiftySlab** - So there's no fiat that gets used in the transaction. Very simply, NiftySlabs will perform verification by matching the ETH wallet address used for payment with the one holding the NFT. In this way, only the holder of the NFT will be able to secure the 1/1 NiftySlab. For your information, the ETH wallet for payment is NiftySlabs.eth\n- **Anonymity Protected** - Anonymity and privacy are taken very seriously by NiftySlabs. They will need some personal information for shipping and customs, but this info will never be shared. Furthermore, this info is properly secured and destroyed once the shipment has been delivered. An e-mail address will also be necessary in order for communication to be established and maintained should the need to contact a client arise along the way\n- **Guaranteed 1/1** - Every label on every NiftySlab includes the name of the collection, the item number and the unique number for search and catalogue purposes. NiftySlabs' catalogue system ensures that only 1 print of a given NFT will ever be allowed to occur. In this way, clients can be sure that they are the only one in the world who owns that NFT.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eYH2jw2.png)\n\n> For some answers to some Frequently Asked Questions, visit the [FAQ page](https://niftyslabs.com/faqs/) over on NiftySlabs' website\n\n## Order Your Very Own NiftySlab!\n\nYes indeed NFT owner, you too can be the proud recipient of your very own NiftySlab! You might be wondering what the cost of such a service is? Well, at the time of writing, and according to NiftySlabs' [Order page,](https://niftyslabs.com/order/) you can expect to pay **0.03 ETH** in order to have your NFT slabbed.\n\nIs this a cool project or what? You're gonna wanna go ahead and follow NiftySlabs on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NiftySlabs) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/niftyslabs/) so that you can find out more about getting NFTs slabbed, sent and preserved for future generations. Oh, they also have a [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vx4QD8hrmu) server you can join if you want to learn more about the project and get some of your NFTs slabbed. Awesome!\n\nAnd so we've reached the end of yet another amazing Discovery of the Day! If you haven't signed up for a MSQ profile yet, I implore you to do so as soon as possible so you get all the latest information served up to you on the regular! Be sure to show NiftySlabs some love and I will see you all again very soon! Until then, buenos dias and stay safe out there...bye bye!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aGOUwoJ.png)\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) on SubStack, and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar)* on Twitter.\n\n*Join the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) and participate in weekly and holiday events when they become available!

From Monday to Friday, we bring you some of our top finds from across the cryptosphere and serve it up to you in the most fun and entertaining way possible. In today's special holiday edition, we're featuring the Top NFT Tech of 2021! Check it out!**_\n\n## The Best in NFT Tech\n\nHey there MSQ fam! 👋\n\nHow was 2021 for you? A lot has changed over the past year, and it can be hard to keep up at the best of times. Having said this, if you've been following our articles and videos that bring you the latest in NFTs, Blockchain Gaming, and more, then you should be pretty savvy with what's been going on. By now you ought to be well ahead of the pack when it comes to navigating the increasingly techno-integrated landscape of the cryptosphere. Hopefully you've followed us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hellomsq) and signed up for a [MSQ.io](https://MSQ.io) profile so you can take part in NFT giveaways and contests on the regular. If you haven't yet...well, what are you waiting for!?\n\nNow how have you been securing all those sick PFPs? Do you know how they were created? Are any of them interactive? NFTs have become a household name this year, but do you know what's under the hood? Learn more about your undeniably legit JPEGs as we count down the Top 3 NFT Technologies of 2021. So without further delay, here we go!\n\n## #3: Programmatically Generated Interactive Artwork\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/J3Cckf5/generative.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nWhile an image itself may not be relevant to every kind of NFT, 2021 has seen the emergence of a new breed of generative interactive artwork that goes well beyond the realm of randomly assigned traits or mutant serums. One awe-inspiring example of this leap in innovation is a prolifically crafty coder known as '[thedude](https://twitter.com/thedudesnft)' whose creations are, _'interactive...built by code, generated at mint.'_\n\nSome of thedude's dudes evolve while others are clickable and follow your mouse's cursor; some even adopt different traits for special occasions. All of them were created using 100% code, and all are generated at mint: no Adobe apps, no iPads, no paint, no paper. And the results are not only ridiculously excellent, but they are also an entirely original concept that undoubtedly opens the door to lots of potentials and will undoubtedly change the way you think about NFTs forever.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/thedudesnft/status/1470441773151436803\"></a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TWrelYb.gif)\n\n</div>\n\nYeah. See. There's _no way_ we can have a 2021 NFT tech list without talking about this mind-blowing breakthrough. Hats off to thedude and his dudes!\n\n> Learn more about thedude's creations in this excellent article by [Reece Smith](https://MSQ.io/users/reece), _['Look Mom! No Artist!' - the dudes NFTs](https://MSQ.io/blog/look-mom-no-artist-the-dudes-nfts)_ on MSQ\n\n## #2: Multi-Signature Security\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/8MbCfpp/keys.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nSecurity. Security. Security.\n\nRegardless of how safe we _think_ we're being, any one of us has the potential to get scammed. Whether you're tricked or outright hacked, having a compromised mnemonic recovery phrase can be devastating. All of your funds and NFTs could ninja vanish into an attacker's wallet. Did the scammer leave a couple pieces you want to rescue, but you just need a little gas first? Best of luck! There are bots that instantly sweep newly-received funds, sometimes within the same block, making it nearly impossible to combat.\n\nIf you happen to be an NFT creator, the consequences can be downright disastrous. For all your best intentions, hopes, and aspirations, a compromised mnemonic also means your projects are compromised too. A malicious actor with access to your recovery phrase can change nearly everything; manipulate artwork, delete all metadata and images, even collect royalties along the way. An absolute nightmare scenario I've seen play out repeatedly.\n\nSo what can you do to mitigate this? A hardware wallet like [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) can be a god-send, but people still get tricked into entering their recovery phrase online, so that alone won't protect you. The answer lies in Multi-Signature security, by far _the_ best solution for protecting your assets. Simply put, instead of relying on a single point of failure, you have a special address that requires the approval of many wallets before a transaction can be considered valid. You can require that either all or a subset of signatures are needed to produce transactions.\n\nFor instance, your Multi-Signature address could be comprised of a cold wallet, a hot wallet, and a Ledger wallet where either all or 2-of-3 signatures are needed. You could have a 3-of-5 scheme, a 5-of-5 scheme, a 5-of-7 scheme, or more. You can even split the signing requirements across multiple users' wallets. The main idea is that access to one account is useless to an attacker. They would need to compromise many or all of your wallets to do any damage. And for that, Multi-Signature security earns the #2 spot on our list.\n\n> To learn more or get started securing your assets using Multi-Signature protection, check out [Gnosis Safe,](https://gnosis-safe.io) The gold standard for corporations and individuals alike\n\n## #1: IPFS\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/cFzZWWn/ipfs.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nIPFS isn't a new technology, but it has certainly made its presence and necessity well-known in 2021. In a year that's seen a sharp increase in scams and rugs, nothing has been more important than _where_ your precious PFPs are stored. And go ahead, take a quick look at your favorite NFTs. Where's the metadata stored? Where are the images stored? Take all the time you need; this is important to understand...\n\nIf it's not on IPFS and is instead privately hosted, not only can your piece just disappear, but you will also have zero evidence for what image is yours. Given this fact, can you genuinely say that _you_ actually even own your NFT? I'd argue that you can't.\n\nIPFS is a distributed persistent storage network. An IPFS address is a resource's storage location and a hash of the resource itself. This hash is unique for every conceivable piece of data, much like a fingerprint. Even one bit being off changes the hash all together, so your metadata and image hashes being registered on-chain is all the evidence you'd ever need. Compare this with centralized storage where your data lives on a private server somewhere. Now consider that server goes down or gets deleted..._Now_ prove you own your image. You can't, because all that's registered on-chain is a web address pointing to something that's no longer there.\n\nSadly, what I've seen again and again is that a project's team bails and leaves the mods and community scrambling to figure out how to revive the project, only to discover all data was privately hosted. Beyond the nearly impossible issue of gaining control of the contract and the potentially costly (tens of thousands of dollars) remedy of dropping a whole new collection to holders, you cannot provably verify who owns what image.\n\nTerrifying, but true. You might not actually own your NFT even though ownership is *supposed* to be the entire point. Had the metadata or images been stored via IPFS, you could, at the absolute least, _prove_ what's yours. And for this, IPFS is, by far, the #1 NFT technology of 2021!\n\n## Happy Holidays, MSQ friends!\n\nWell, folks, that just about concludes our nifty NFT journey for today. We learned about groundbreaking PFPs you can click, the best way to CYA _(cover your assets)_, and how you can be 100% sure your NFTs are rug-resistant and provably yours. I have a feeling this is just the veritable tip of the iceberg, and I'm personally excited to see what comes next in the world of NFTs!\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/hmptr8F/msq-nfts.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nWe hope you enjoyed our little holiday side-quest and wish you nothing but the best this holiday season and throughout 2022!\n\nSee you soon, MSQ fam!

MSQ recently moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can now sign up for a profile and enjoy the site to its full extent. From Monday to Friday we bring you our Discovery of the Day series that focuses on some of our top picks from across the cryptosphere. In today's edition we briefly look at some of the most popular space-themed projects from 2021. Let's dive right in!***\n\n## Our Fascination With the Universe\n\nSince we became conscious of ourselves, we have had an ever-deepening interest in the universe. It seems that the more we look, the bigger and more incomprehensible it becomes! In other words, the more we understand, the more we realize we don't really understand. That's a pretty profound thought, and while we may not be significant in the eyes of cosmos, we still wish to know more and explore its seemingly endless depths...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LQQ5YZG.jpg)\n\n> How many stars are there? Not sure, but it's a whole lot\n\n2021 saw the meteoric rise of Non-Fungible Tokens, more commonly known as NFTs. With the success of digital artists such as [Beeple](https://www.beeple-crap.com/) and the ascent of projects like [BAYC](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/) and [Lazy Lions,](https://www.lazylionsnft.com/) thousands of creators and developers have banded together to bring their own offerings to the NFT space in the hopes of replicating the successes they've witnessed. NFTs also exist in forms beyond generative art, and several are integral components within several Blockchain-based Games such as [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) and [Blankos Block Party.](https://blankos.com/)\n\n2021 has also seen several space-themed Blockchain projects come to the fore. In today's special holiday Discovery of the Day, we take a look at three of some of the most ambitious NFT projects that are set in space and have also appeared on MSQ in the past. Let's go!\n\n## Star Atlas\n\nArguably the most hyped and ambitious space-themed project in the cryptosphere is none other than [Star Atlas,](https://staratlas.com/) a 'next-gen gaming metaverse' built on the [Solana](https://solana.com/) Ecosystem. With the ability to purchase and customize your own spaceship, explore an ever-expanding universe and participate in a host of activities from mining to all-out warfare, Star Atlas aims to be the most immersive, engaging and rewarding Blockchain Game ever. Just take a look at the cinematic trailer they released back in October and you'll see why this is no endeavor to turn your nose up at:\n\n![](youtube:ciFSSd39pAY)\n\nWith such an ambitious Roadmap and so much to consider, will Star Atlas be able to deliver on everything they're promising? Only time will tell. There's no doubt that there's a tremendous amount of energy around the project, and there are regular updates posted via their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/staratlas) account. If the team behind this triple A project gets it right, the results will be nothing short of incredible. Keep in mind that [Star Citizen,](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/star-citizen) a game with similar ambitions, has been in development for nearly 10 years now and received over $400 million in funding...and still no full version. This isn't to say that Star Atlas won't succeed, but don't expect a full release anytime soon!\n\nOn the plus side, if you're in now, you're in early, and the possibilities are indeed very promising. Whatever the case, we here at MSQ will be watching Star Atlas with great interest in 2022 and beyond! Looks good!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GIVZzk5.png)\n\n> Read more about **Star Atlas** in this MSQ article by [Matt Spizarny:](https://MSQ.io/users/spizzo) [Own the Galaxy in Star Atlas](https://MSQ.io/blog/own-the-galaxy-in-star-atlas)\n\n## Starl\n\nAnother huge project set in space that has garnered plenty of attention is [Starl,](https://www.starltoken.com/) 'a virtual Blockchain-based Metaverse set in space where you can explore, play, trade and socialize with other players.' On this basis Starl sounds very similar to Star Atlas, but their approaches differ somewhat. For one, Starl is already in the process of building their own proprietary [NFT marketplace](https://market.starltoken.com/market) which is currently in its Beta phase. Starl have already held a few Living Module sales, and at present, every single Living Module is sold out! In fact, despite only having been around for a few short months, Starl seems to have enjoyed several successes. Check out this recent Twitter post and you'll see what I mean:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/StarLinkETH/status/1470061237840924673\"></a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nOh, another cool part of this project is that Starl is working towards building an *actual* space station! Is that not one of the coolest things you've ever heard? One thing I can tell you is that the Starl community is extremely active and very enthusiastic. In fact, I think it may have been our most popular Discovery of the Day for 2021! While we've had some great responses to our articles, the Starl community certainly went above and beyond my own expectations. On this basis alone I would say that Starl has a very bright future ahead, but we shall see. 2022 will definitely be an interesting one for the world of Blockchain, and I hope to see Starl and its community to continue to grow in the months and years to come!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TacLL2t.png)\n\n> Read more about **Starl** in this MSQ article by [Brynn Huxtable:](https://MSQ.io/users/brynn) [Space, The Metaverse and NFTs - Starl](https://MSQ.io/blog/space-the-metaverse-and-nfts-starl)\n\n## Frontier\n\nI have to say, this is one of my personal favorite projects of 2021 with a great community, awesome lore and a whole depth of complexity to it. [Frontier](https://www.missingfrontier.com/) is a Blockchain-based game that is as enticing as it is mysterious. Featuring The Watcher, a faceless character reminiscent of Isaac Clarke in the [Dead Space](https://www.ea.com/games/dead-space) franchise, Frontier is a community-driven online PvP game that aims to hold global competitions. As you may have guessed, much of the game's mechanics depend on different kinds of NFTs that allow players to participate in matches and gain the advantage over their opponents. Some of these NFTs include:\n\n- **Black Boxes** - contain two random flash blocks if opened, but may remain unopened\n- **Flash Blocks** - Weapons and shields, traps and hacks to be used in-game\n- **Glitch Blocks** - The ultimate weapon that can be employed in-game\n- **Watchers** - The default unit type in Frontier\n- **Zeroes** - A special unit type in Frontier\n- **Data Keys** - non-playable, utility NFTs that guarantee premium advantages\n\nDespite being a relatively small community at this point, Frontier's following is a devout one, and the dedication of its team and community is something to marvel at. The project's social media pages are always buzzing with announcements and activity—just check out this latest post from Frontier's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/missingfrontier) page and you'll see what I mean:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/missingfrontier/status/1472624214863667208\"></a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nThat's not all though...there's a whole lot of lore behind Frontier. If you want to find out more and hear the story of The Watcher, then you'll need to follow him on [Twitter:](https://twitter.com/missingwatcher)\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/missingwatcher/status/1417905608825712643\"></a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nThere's a whole lot going on with Frontier and I just can't cover it in totality in this article.

      "body": "***Greetings everyone and Happy Holidays! MSQ recently moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can sign up for a profile and explore all the site has to offer! From Monday to Friday we bring you some of the best projects the cryptosphere has to offer. From NFTs and DeFi to Blockchain games and the Metaverse, you’ll find it all right here on MSQ! In today's special holiday Discovery of the Day, we take a look at 5 awesome Blockchain games coming in 2022!***\n\n## A Taste of What's to Come!\n\nIt's nearly time for the bells to ring and for us to welcome in a brand new year. 2021 has been nothing short of a crazy ride for the Blockchain industry which saw a boom in NFTs, Bitcoin becoming legal tender in El Salvador (and reaching ATHs for that matter), and of course, Blockchain gaming bursting onto the scene. With the New Year just around the corner, we thought it'd be fun to take a peek at some epic games coming in 2022. So strap in and get your keyboard (or controller) ready and let's get stuck in!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OMJtW7E.gif)\n\n## Illuvium\n\nFirst up we have ***[Illuvium,](https://www.illuvium.io/)*** the first triple-A game to enter the space! *Illuvium* is an open-world RPG adventure game built on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. Players journey across a vast and untamed landscape in their quest to hunt down and capture deity-like creatures called 'Illuvials.' Ultimately it is up to participants to discover the cause of the cataclysm that shattered the world of Illuvium.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XjVAosC.png)\n\nIn *Illuvium,* players will be able to:\n\n- Race across crystal labyrinths, toxic deserts, and windswept mountain summits\n- Hunt down and capture Illuvials, powerful creatures who rule the land of Illuvium\n- Train and fuse their Illuvials into powerful evolutions\n- Build their ultimate Illuvial team to take into battles and tournaments in PvE and PvP arenas\n- Use their creativity to build unique synergies to outsmart their opponents\n- Hit a winning streak as they best other hunters to become the strongest Ranger on Illuvium\n\n*Illuvium’s* collectible NFT games feature crypto token assets with functionality and a gaming use case, interoperable across the *Illuvium* universe and the larger DeFi metaverse. The decentralized NFT collection offers players a user-maintained custody never-before-seen in mainstream gaming.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ml0kBXs.png)\n\nAfter watching the [trailer,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzT88eN4gts&ab_channel=Illuvium) it's safe to say the game sports rich visuals and some awesome animations. At the time of writing, the release date is set for some point in 2022. For now, be sure to register on *Illuvium's* [official website](https://www.illuvium.io/) and follow their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/illuviumio) to stay up to date with the game's development!\n\n## The Walking Dead: Empires\n\nA recent partnership between [Gala Games](https://app.gala.games/) and [AMC](https://www.amc.com/) means that *The Walking Dead* is coming to Blockchain! Now that's some exciting news! ***[The Walking Dead: Empires](https://twdempires.game/)*** is an MMORPG set in *The Walking Dead* Universe, or more specifically the US state of Georgia (as seen in the popular TV series).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yByBO7u.png)\n\nHowever, the location isn’t the only overlap between the TV series and upcoming game. In fact, there’s going to be up to 30 original characters from the show appearing in the game! We’re talking Michonne Hawthorne, Rick Grimes, Glenn Rhee! What a line up! In addition to these characters, the game will include each of their signature weapons including Lucille (Negan’s baseball bat), Sasha’s sniper rifle, Rick’s Colt Python and more!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4sUeQfp.jpg)\n\nBesides the original characters making an appearance, the game will also include some famous landmarks from the show. Since the game is based in Georgia, it’s confirmed that we’ll see locations like Hershel Greene’s Farm as well as the infamous Prison. Having said this, the developers are also creating a number of areas that are entirely unique to the game.\n\nOK, OK, so we’ve covered enough about the content of the game...now let’s take some time to dig into its mechanics and what you’re actually going to be able to do:\n\n- Craft weapons and fight for survival\n- Defend what’s yours and even take from others in a world where anything goes\n- Construct a base on your land and build defenses to ward off walkers and humans alike\n- Invite others to settle on your land and reap the benefits of what they grow and build\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/j7GfbIF.jpg)\n\nCurrently, there is no set release date for *The Walking Dead: Empires.* However, we expect to see some gameplay teasers within the next few months! be sure to follow Gala Games on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GoGalaGames) to keep up with all the latest news and updates concerning *The Walking Dead: Empires.*\n\n## Star Atlas\n\n**[Star Atlas](https://staratlas.com/)** is an open-world, space exploration, grand strategy MMORPG set in a galactic universe, with Play-to-Earn (P2E) mechanics and player ownership. Players pilot ships and engage in trade, commerce, and battle with others for scarce resources. *Star Atlas* is a virtual gaming metaverse emerging from the confluence of state of the art Blockchain, real-time graphics, multiplayer video game, and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) technologies. By harnessing the [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) 5’s *Nanite*, cinema quality video game visuals are possible in real-time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HFDPvdz.jpg)\n\nNot only is *Star Atlas* full of grand space exploration, it also includes the ability to:\n\n- Control land and territory\n- Control vehicles and manage your fleet\n- Set up space and land-based mining operations\n- Player versus Environment (PvE) and Player versus Player (PvP)\n- Experience the game in VR\n\nIn addition, *Star Atlas* features an NFT marketplace that allows players to sell and trade the items they obtain while playing the game. The *Star Atlas* Universal Marketplace connects all players in-game to buy and sell all asset types and post job listings for paid in-game tasks. The majority of assets traded on the marketplace will be earned by engaging in in-game tasks. However, it is also a place to list assets purchased from both the pre-sale and concept sale.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yMDJYFS.png)\n\nBlockchain technology built on the [Solana](https://solana.com/) protocol ensures a largely serverless and secure gameplay experience. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) obtained and traded within *Star Atlas* leads to the creation of an economy that replicates the tangibility of real world assets and ownership. To learn more, visit the official *Star Atlas* [website](https://staratlas.com/) and be sure to follow them on [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/staratlas)\n\n## The Sandbox\n\nSo are [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) and [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/) the be all end all of sandbox games and game creation platforms? Nope. Not by a long shot. I’d like to bring your attention to a project that takes some of the best components of these two games and combines them with the best of Blockchain tech and the Metaverse. Yes indeed, **[The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/)** is what you might consider a ‘Metaverse ecosystem’ that runs on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. In this virtual world, players can build, own and monetize their gaming experience and assets. *The Sandbox’s* native ERC-20 token, $SAND, may be traded, staked and used to take part in the governance and evolution of the ecosystem as a whole.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gBAWjty.jpg)\n\n*The Sandbox* Metaverse is made up of LANDS, parts of the world that are bought and owned by players to create and monetize experiences. There will only ever be 166,464 LANDS available which can be used to host games, build multiplayer experiences, create housing, or offer social experiences to the community.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hu1TKBu.png)\n\nNFTs are a large component of *The Sandbox.* Swords, armor, plots of land and so on are all NFTs in *The Sandbox* Metaverse. $SAND is the main utility token that allows players to buy and sell LANDS and ASSETS in *The Sandbox* Metaverse.\n\nAt the moment, *The Sandbox* is in its Alpha phase. Those who have an Alpha pass can access up to 18 exclusive experiences, earn 1,000 $SAND and 3 exclusive NFTs. To access the Alpha you must own one of the 5,000 Alpha passes which can be purchased via OpenSea or won in contests. If you want to receive all the latest updates on *The Sandbox*, be sure to follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheSandboxGame) and visit their [official website.](https://www.sandbox.game/)\n\n## Guild of Guardians\n\nLast but not least we have **[Guild of Guardians](https://www.guildofguardians.com/)**, a mobile RPG where players can turn their passion for gaming into assets by building their dream team of ‘Guardians’ and competing in a guild to earn epic, tradeable rewards. Players will also be able to play for free and earn heroes and items without having to spend any money if they so wish.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FIpZzmV.png)\n\nThe game is built on the Ethereum Blockchain with unique ERC-721s (NFTs) functioning as in-game assets. The team is also using [Immutable X](https://www.immutable.com/), the first Layer 2 for NFTs on Ethereum, ensuring zero gas fees and instant trades for players. *Guild of Guardians* will not be pay-to-win since skill and strategy will ultimately be the core elements of the game. In addition, spending money on *Guild of Guardians* won't come at the expense of other players because the game is not focused on PvP.\n\nYou can't play *Guild of Guardians* just yet. However, the game is in its first stage of release, meaning players can start collecting founder heroes. In terms of the game itself, the team is working hard to finish the arduous task of development and bringing a polished product to market. Make sure you follow *Guild of Guardians* on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GuildOfGuardian) to keep up to date with the game's progress! At the time of writing, the intention is to release *Guild of Guardians* on mobile in early 2022, but no actual date has been announced as yet.\n\n## Game On!\n\nIf I could only choose only one of the above games, I'd have to say I'm most excited for *The Walking Dead: Empires* (probably because I'm a huge fan of *The Walking Dead!*) What game are you most excited for? Be sure to let us know via any one of our social media pages—we'd love to hear what you think!\n\nThat's it for this Discovery of the Day holiday special!

      "body": "***Hello and welcome back to another Discovery of the Day holiday special! MSQ is now in its Open Beta, meaning you can sign up for a profile and enjoy all the site has to offer. From Monday to Friday we bring you our top picks from across the cryptosphere. In today's special edition, we take a look at some of the awesome Decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects we featured here on MSQ in 2021. Let's go!***\n\n## The Evolution of DeFi\n\nThere are tons of DeFi protocols to choose from—[Uniswap,](https://uniswap.org/) [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/) and [SushiSwap](https://sushi.com/) are a few names that come to mind. At present, most DeFi is built on top of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain, and in all honesty, this is somewhat problematic. First and foremost, if DeFi is meant to be 'decentralized,' then existing primarily on top of a single (and rather inefficient) Blockchain isn't going to cut it. Even [Vitalik Buterin,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin) the wunderkind behind the Ethereum Ecosystem, has said that Ethereum needs to 'expand beyond just trading tokens and helping to create other tokens' if a collapse and regulatory nightmare is to be avoided. If tokens are being created on top of others without adding any real utility, the entire system isn't going to make it in the long term.\n\nAnother aspect of DeFi that needs addressing is its accessibility and concerns around the security. Earlier this year, on August 10th, the biggest DeFi hack yet went down when [PolyNetwork](https://poly.network/) saw more than $610 million worth of tokens stolen from the Ethereum, [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) (formerly Matic) and [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain) platforms. A huge amount of controversy emerged after this incident and the appearance of a 'white hat' hacker that helped to return a large portion of the funds with many calling it an inside job.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zIe9tmf.gif)\n\n> This is literally what hackers look like...just sayin'\n\n> Find out more about the PolyNetwork Hack and DeFi hacks in general in my MSQ articles: **Hacking the DeFi Ecosystem** [(Part I)](https://MSQ.io/blog/hacking-the-defi-ecosystem-part-i) & [(Part II)](https://MSQ.io/blog/hacking-the-defi-ecosystem-part-ii)\n\nIn all honesty, in order for DeFi to succeed, it has to move away from being based on a single Blockchain and address a number of issues that have caused so many problems in the past. In the past months I've had the fortune of talking to and creating content with some amazing DeFi projects from different Blockchains, and all are working diligently to create platforms that lower barriers to entry, reduce costs and make the experience far less stressful for both experienced and new users. Let's dive right in!\n\n## Polkadex\n\nHaving launched its Mainnet on 29th September 2021, [Polkadex](https://www.polkadex.trade/) is a fully Decentralized Exchange (DEX) built on Substrate. In essence, Polkadex combines the best of Centralized Exchanges (CEXes) with DEXes, providing end-users with a DeFi experience second to none. The platform boasts a number of features including:\n\n- **Trustless Cross-Chain Transfers** - Bring any Blockchain token to Polkadex in a trustless and non-custodial manner\n- **On-Chain Trading Bots** - High-Frequency Trading (HFT) for both retail and institutional investors\n- **Offchain State Commits** - Operators can maintain the Polkadex Orderbook via a Layer 2 Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)\n- **Unmatched Performance** - Polkadex boasts 500,000 transactions per second (TPS), ensuring an unparalleled trading experience\n\nSince its launch, Polkadex has gone from strength to strength, and as of December 11th 2021, there are over 1,000 nominators actively staking their $PDEX on the the Polkadex network and earning more than 60% APY. Now that's some impressive returns!\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/polkadex/status/1469447153412050946\"></a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nThere's still a lot on the cards for Polkadex. As such, the team is hard at work implementing several fixes to the protocol including UI fixes for PolkaIDO as well as design improvements for the Orderbook web application. See for yourself:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/polkadex/status/1472680387981856768\"></a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nThere's little doubt that Polkadex will continue to add to its utility and functionality as 2022 progresses. I encourage you to follow the protocol on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/polkadex) and check out their [official website](https://www.polkadex.trade/) for more detailed information about Polkadex's capabilities.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bNwDZVe.png)\n\n> I had the pleasure of talking to Poladex's CMO, [Kseniia Baziian](https://twitter.com/KseniiaBaziian), for MSQ a few months ago. Check out the full interview over on the official MSQ [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsjT9B_HUkg) channel\n\n## Opdex\n\nIn the very near future, [Opdex](https://www.opdex.com/) will be releasing the first DeFi protocol in C# executed by the .NET CLR. For those of you who don't know, Opdex is the first set of Decentralized Exchange (DEX) protocols within the [Stratis](https://www.stratisplatform.com/) ecosystem. Opdex protocols gives users the ability to engage in trustless token swaps, provide liquidity, mine and stake, all in an entirely gas efficient and non-custodial manner. Sounds exciting, doesn't it?\n\nOn November 25th 2021, Liquidity Mining became available on the Opdex Testnet (which went live on November 21st), meaning users could start mining all-new test governance tokens to stake with or provide additional liquidity. Check it out:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/OpdexProtocol/status/1463934059428655107\"></a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n> Check out my MSQ [DeFi Spotlight](https://MSQ.io/blog/defi-spotlight-opdex) to learn more about Opdex and the team behind it\n\nMore recently, on December 16th 2021, Opdex announced the upcoming release of $ODX, Opdex's governance token providing the necessary power for DeFi staking, liquidity mining and more:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/stratisplatform/status/1471557919946727436\"></a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n$ODX is slated for Mainnet release on Cirrus in January 2022.\n\n> Read more about $ODX in this informative [Medium article](https://blog.opdex.com/introducing-odx-82ea356940e5) by Opdex\n\nHaving been part of the Stratis community for quite some time and talked to [Tyler Peña,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylerpena/) the founder of Opdex, I am pretty confident in Opdex's capacity to achieve everything it hopes to. 2022 promises to be a very busy year for Opdex and the Stratis Community, but based on the support the protocol has received and the expertise of the people behind it, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little excited about what's on the horizon.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DRKQAKD.png)\n\n> Tyler was actually one of the first people I interviewed for MSQ. You can watch the full interview over on the official MSQ [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L30Pvl2Uwlw&t=259s) channel\n\n## DeFi in 2022 and Beyond!\n\nIt's been nothing short of a rip-roaring year for crypto, and I anticipate that 2022 will mirror or even exceed much of the energy we've seen throughout 2021. Both Polkadex and Opdex have extremely competent teams behind them and enthusiastic and motivated communities providing them with the support they need. While there are many DeFi protocols out there, few have the right mix of elements to succeed in the long run. I've no doubt that 2022 will bring further developments for both of these amazing protocols, and I hope to cover their progress as they continue to build their offerings and bring DeFi to a wider audience.\n\nThat's it for today everyone. If you haven't signed up for a MSQ profile yet, you'll want to get registered ASAP so you can enjoy all the site has to offer. Thanks for joining me today - may you all have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy and Prosperous New Year!

From Monday to Friday, we bring you some of our top finds from across the cryptosphere and serve it up to you in the most fun and entertaining way possible. In today's special holiday edition, we're featuring the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly sides of NFT Communities!**_\n\n## A Look Back\n\nThe world has changed a lot over the past few years—we work differently, eat differently, shop differently; even the way we enjoy entertainment has evolved. That's not to say we weren't already on this course to begin with, but the rate of change has undoubtedly accelerated, and 2021 was no exception.\n\nYour friends, your colleagues, the relationships around you have likely changed as well. Perhaps this helps explain why online communities have flourished recently. Humans are social creatures, and a group identity, belonging to something bigger, is in our DNA. We've discovered new ways to navigate our increasingly techno-integrated lives and learnt how to connect more meaningfully despite the distances between us.\n\nI spent quite a bit of 2021 in and around online communities looking for NFT projects to write about, and something I couldn't help but notice is that many feel like an echo chamber where voices get lost while others should simply be avoided all together. However, there are a great deal many that feel like home...\n\nIt's no surprise that being part of a good community is great for our mental health, and conversely, toxic environments only serve to isolate and alienate people. In a world that's changed so much so quickly, it's important to recognize and engage in meaningful and supportive communities. So today, we take a closer look at the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly sides of NFT communities.\n\n> Speaking of good and supportive communities, make sure to follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hellomsq) and sign up for a [MSQ.io](https://MSQ.io) profile so you can be part of the MSQ fam and participate in NFT giveaways and contests\n\n## The Good \n\n<div style=\"width: 70%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/K798SjY/good.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nAs Maya Angelou once stated, _'The ache for home lives in all of us,'_ and this rings truer than ever as of late. Home is what great communities feel like, a place we feel accepted no matter what we're going through. We're all on different paths, and that's something the good ones understand. They welcome us with open arms and take us as we are. These are the kinds of communities where you end up bonding with others, many times becoming friends across various social media platforms, DMing each other new projects, or just to check in and say hello.\n\nAnother thing I absolutely love to see while exploring new communities is people being supportive and collaborative. 'Yes. This is how it _should_ be!' I often find myself thinking. This is one of the most important things I take into consideration when choosing a project to write about too—members going out of their way to help others, whether they're new to the scene or have been there since the beginning; collaborating and intermingling with other projects and communities, forging new partnerships along the way. These are exactly the kinds of things that grow a community and, more importantly, what we all need—a _good_ place to call home.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n![](twitter:iwwon_official/status/1473287214876528640)\n\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n[@CryptoMories](https://twitter.com/cryptomories) creator, [iwwon](https://twitter.com/iwwon_official)\n  \n</div>\n\n## The Bad\n\n<div style=\"width: 70%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/KFpsM9s/bad.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nI've also gone into communities where I feel my voice gets lost in the static. While this can sometimes be the result of a massive membership, more often than not, it's because there's a lack of empathy among its members. Genuine questions, praise, dissent, requests for help; they are all treated equally in that they are all readily dismissed. Others are either too busy or good to reply or be even remotely welcoming.\n\nThese are the places where you'll find that tribalism, hype, and calls of mooning aren't merely present, but the status quo. Some of the most promising projects devolve into echo chambers, and it's unfortunate to see. There's so much potential if only people would lighten up and be friendly to each other. Projects and communities where attitudes like these are the most prevalent are best to be avoided. A calm headspace just isn't worth sacrificing—your time is better spent elsewhere!\n\n## The Ugly\n\n<div style=\"width: 70%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/xSLQmQN/ugly.jpg)\n\n</div>\n\nThe Facebooks of the NFT world. I can usually spot these communities right away, and it's not difficult once you've seen it. All dissension and legitimate concerns aren't just ignored; users are outright and immediately perma-banned. There's hostility and petty in-fighting, arguments over whether or not the project is a rug...it's all manner of ridiculousness and nothing but radio silence from the team.\n\nThese communities are the ones that throw up _all_ of the red flags. I've sadly seen many ignoring their gut and holding onto hope that they're not throwing precious time and energy into a lost cause. You can almost hear the doubt in each of their comments. It's painful to watch, and you just end up feeling bad to watch seemingly good people get gaslit by what almost always end up, indeed, being a rug, or at worst, a *slow rug.* Avoid these spaces like the plague. If you're already in too deep, it's never too late. There are plenty of places out there that are ready and willing to welcome you with open arms.\n\n## Further Together\n\nEven the greatest of projects and communities can have elements that are good, bad, or ugly, but what's important is which way the scales tip and how each member chooses to handle the negativity. I'm sure many of you are familiar with the saying, 'If you want to go further, go together.' And while its origin is, ironically, a subject of debate, what should matter is that it's correct. Humanity thrives on cooperation, and a lack thereof inevitably leads to ruin. So it's important to remember now, more than ever, to cut each other some slack. We're all battling something. So in the immortal words of Bill S. Preston, Esquire...\n\n![](https://media3.giphy.com/media/l4KhRsScQKgWZzqO4/giphy.gif)\n\nThanks again for stopping by, MSQ fam.

      "body": "***Greetings everyone and Happy Holidays! MSQ recently moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can sign up for a profile and explore all the site has to offer! From Monday to Friday we bring you some of the best projects the cryptosphere has to offer. From NFTs and DeFi to Blockchain games and the Metaverse, you’ll find it all right here on MSQ! Today we bring you our 2021 MSQ NFT Recap where we feature some of the most popular projects of the year!***\n\n## The Digital Mother Lode\n\nHundreds of NFT projects are created every day, and several are featured on MSQ every week! But as with anything in life, some of these stand out and are more popular than others. Whether this is because of their art, community, core team and/or features is a matter of opinion. Either way, we're going to take a look at three of the most popular projects featured on MSQ this year, namely [Lazy Lions,](https://www.lazylionsnft.com/) [Splinterlands](https://splinterlands.com/) & [The Doge Pound!](https://thedogepoundnft.com/) Let's go!\n\n## Lazy Lions\n\nLazy Lions has to be one of my favorite NFT projects of all time! The community has no chill and I literally see them every minute I'm on Twitter—it's definitely a special one to belong to. Lazy Lions is a collection of 10,000 unique lion NFTs. Hidden in a secure, top-secret location, The Lazy Lions Private Island is open exclusively to the VIP members of the Lazy Lion community. The visionary artist behind this incredible project that has taken the world by storm goes by the name of [Rizzio](https://twitter.com/0x50D9). Each Lazy Lion is one of a kind and programmatically generated from over 160 different traits including clothing, manes, expressions, and so on.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rw8qVWJ.jpg)\n\nOne of the best parts about Lazy Lions is their [ROARwards](https://roarwards.lazylionsnft.com/) program. Every month, every Lazy Lion holder receives some ETH simply for owning and holding on to their Lazy Lion(s). All of this is as a result of royalties that arise from the sales of Lazy Lions NFTs.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iKb0d0P.png)\n\nLazy Lions also features [Bungalows,](https://opensea.io/collection/lazy-lions-bungalows) banners that allow you to display your NFTs. How you may ask? Well, the team developed a dApp that allows you to select different NFTs to display on the banner by simply connecting your MetaMask wallet. You can customize your own Lazy Lions Bungalow with NFT artwork [here](https://bungalows.lazylionsnft.com/). Finally, the team is working on a Lazy Lions Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that will be released along with community prizes in the near future.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WBtJU3N.jpg)\n\n## Splinterlands\n\nNext up we have Splinterlands, a trading card game built using Blockchain technology that allows users to play and trade anytime and earn every win. Players compete for a limited reward pool of the Splinterlands in-game token called Dark Energy Crystals ($DEC) as well as provably rare and valuable NFTs from daily quests and bi-weekly season rewards. Participants battle for glory and riches or may decided to passively rent out their cards if they so wish. At the time of writing, there have been $4,811,505 in tournament prizes awarded. That's pretty crazy!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hcdKywc.png)\n\nSplinterlands makes it easy to earn on a daily basis. Players can win rewards from Tournaments, Ranked play, and Quests. No matter your skill level or collection size, there is always an opportunity to earn! Among the many prizes players may win are collectible cards of varying rarity, card packs, magic potions, and Dark Energy Crystals (a tradable digital currency that can be used to buy items in the shop).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/t4UxEiT.jpg)\n\n## The Doge Pound\n\nFinally we have [The Doge Pound,](https://thedogepoundnft.com/) an NFT collection that consists of 10,000 art pieces carefully chosen by Professor Elon. Each NFT is expertly designed, specially picked, and impeccably shaped. Owning a Doge Pound NFT grants you full creative and commercial rights, as well as inclusion within the Doge Pound community.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Vl7tH3G.png)\n\nIn terms of longevity, the project has already established a community grant fund with an initial amount of $30,000. This will be a means by which artists, developers, and other individuals can increase utility or create additional art for the Doge Pound community. Moreover, 2.5% of OpenSea fees will go directly to the community grant program for an indefinite period of time. As an added bonus, The Doge Pound released [Doge Pound Puppies](https://thedogepoundnft.com/puppy) which effectively serve as companions to the original collection.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hkfxb3Q.png)\n\nThe team are in the process of getting the Doges ready for the Metaverse! After completion of the Roadmap, the path of this project will be determined by the various members of the project's community. From what it appears, the intention is to make The Doge Pound community one that is tightly knit, active and a fun place to be!\n\n## Happy New Year! Here's to 2022!\n\nAnd that's it everybody! A big shout out to these awesome NFT projects that helped make 2021 exciting and memorable! We'll be sure to follow them all closely and are totally amped to see what they bring to the NFT space throughout 2022!\n\nIf you don't have a MSQ profile yet, make sure you sign up for one so that you don't miss a thing!

MSQ recently moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can now sign up for a profile and enjoy all the features the site has to offer! From Monday to Friday we bring you our Discovery of the Day featuring some of the most exciting and promising projects in the cryptosphere. In today's special holiday edition, we take a look at some of the biggest projects working to build and grow the Metaverse. Here we go!***\n\n## The Merging of Realities\n\nImagine being online all the time and connected to people in a seamless virtual environment, engaging in just about everything you might expect to experience in the physical world, but also being able to do just about anything that virtual world permits you to. Whether you love or hate the concept, the Metaverse is a big deal right now, and there are numerous companies including [Facebook,](https://www.facebook.com/) (which in a rather controversial move rebranded to [Meta,](https://about.facebook.com/meta/)) working to bring their vision of this vast virtual world to life.\n\nThe idea of buying, owning and transacting in a digital space may sound strange, and for all intents and purposes, it is...but the beauty of the Metaverse, if done *correctly*, is that many people will be able to participate and freely engage in a range of activities regardless of where they are in the world. This includes buying and selling assets, hiring out land for events, and building unique experiences for people to enjoy. In many ways, the Metaverse has the potential to be nothing short of a paradise for creators and gamers alike, allowing those with skills to use them in a meaningful way and provide their services to a permanently present international audience.\n\nOf course, not everybody is delighted about the Metaverse, especially when companies like Facebook are getting involved. In case you don't know, Facebook isn't exactly known for its integrity and ethics. I'm sure many would assert that it's been utterly ruinous for countless people and played a fundamental role in engineering our social behaviors and perceptions. In many ways the battle for the Metaverse is divided between two encampments—existing companies that are looking to evolve in order to stay relevant and profitable, and decentralized projects attempting to harness the power of their communities to build something truly democratic and autonomous. This is likely something of an oversimplification, but I'm personally rooting for the latter 'side.'\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/a0Oca9J.png)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center\">\n\nMany of you probably feel the same...\n\n</div>\n\nSo as it stands, there are a couple of big projects already building their own versions of the Metaverse, and throughout the course of 2022, I'm expecting some big things from them. Let's take a brief look at each one in turn and outline what they're about\n\n## The Sandbox\n\nWith names like [Snoop Dogg,](https://snoopdogg.com/) [Deadmau5](https://deadmau5.com/) and [Atari,](https://www.atari.com/) [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/) is arguably the biggest and most ambitious Metaverse project in the cryptosphere. Featuring *Minecraft*-style graphics, a fully functioning virtual marketplace and even a Game Maker, *The Sandbox* is going all-out in its bid to establish an immersive and compelling virtual world in which people can create experiences and trade digital assets with one another.\n\nAlpha Season 1 of *The Sandbox* concluded recently, and from what it appears, it was a huge success. Take a look at some of the metrics below:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Dkwq7rF.png)\n\nAlpha Season 2 is coming soon and, based on feedback received from those who participated in Season 1, you can expect the following:\n\n- Open to everyone to participate and progress through experiences\n- More Alpha Passes available\n- New types of Experiences\n- Even more Play-to-Earn (P2E) Rewards\n- Some surprises in the Metaverse\n\nWith an enormous Twitter following, big brands and celebrities involved, The Sandbox is constantly growing in popularity and promises to be one of the most impressive undertakings ever seen in the cryptosphere. Be sure to follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheSandboxGame) and join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vAe4zvY) so you hear all the latest news as and when it's released.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1HL2ELG.jpg)\n\n> You can read more about *The Sandbox* in my MSQ article: [The Sandbox - An NFT-Powered Metaverse Gaming Ecosystem](https://MSQ.io/blog/the-sandbox-an-nft-powered-metaverse-gaming-ecosystem)\n\n## Decentraland\n\nMore or less on a par with *The Sandbox* is [Decentraland,](https://decentraland.org/) a Metaverse project that also allows participants to trade digital assets, buy land and take part in a range of events and activities. While The Sandbox uses pixel art-style graphics, *Decentraland* uses WebGL and runs in-browser, meaning users don't require a graphics card in order to play. However, if you do own a suitably powerful GPU, you'll most likely find that your gameplay experience is significantly enhanced.\n\nWhile it may take a slightly different approach, *Decentraland* is a major player in the space with plots of land selling for thousands of dollars (denoted in the platform's native token, $MANA). From March 24th to the 27th 2022, *Decentraland* will be hosting Metaverse Fashion Week, giving designers and fashionistas the opportunity to showcase their material to an international audience in an entirely virtual space. Check it out!\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n![](twitter:decentraland/status/1475180264309596166)\n  \n</div>\n\n*Decentraland's* development is governed almost entirely by the Decentraland DAO (Decentralzied Autonomous Organization). What this means is that the members of the *Decentraland* community determine the way everything works—from what wearables are allowed (or disallowed) to land auction policies and content moderation to event types, it is the users and participants in *Decentraland* who ultimately determine how everything will pan out.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cKtW1xr.png)\n\nWith so much going on and so much planned for 2022, it would be remiss not to follow *Decentraland,* so be sure to check them out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/decentraland) and join their [Discord](https://decentraland.org/discord/) so that you don't miss out on any of the latest news and announcements.\n\n## Solice\n\nLast but certainly not least, we have [Solice,](https://solice.io/) the first cross platform VR Metaverse on the [Solana](https://solana.com/) Blockchain. *Solice* hasn't actually launched yet, but according to their Roadmap, a 1.1 release (soft launch) should take place sometime in Q1 of 2022. In essence Solice will allow users to trade digital assets, create experiences and trade freely with one another, so it is not unlike *The Sandbox* and *Decentraland.* However, *Solice* will allow users to interact with the Metaverse in VR as well as without a VR system. Moreover, the project appears more graphically ambitious and polished than existing Metaverse efforts, but just how ambitious remains to be seen.\n\nAs it turns out, the Solice IDO Whitelist just went live on December 27th. You can read the IDO Guidelines and find out more information by following the links in the following Tweet:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n![](twitter:solanium_io/status/1475436598518894592)\n  \n</div>\n\nThe *Solice* token sale will go live on [Solanium](https://www.solanium.io/project/solice/) on December 29th, 2021. In fact, at the time of writing, the sale is due to take place in 12 hours time, so hopefully you find out about it before it's over!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KUDwrOg.png)\n\n*Solice* is still right at the beginning of its journey, but there's a lot of energy and support behind it. Follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/solice_io) and join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hybrRStrKe) for all the latest news and updates on the project's development.\n\n> You can find out more about *Solice* via their [official documentation](https://docs.solice.io/)\n\n## The Growth of the Metaverse in 2022!\n\nThere's been so much that's happened in the last 12 months, but 2022 will almost certainly see an even greater amount of time, effort and capital being plowed into the development of Metaverse experiences for people of all nationalities and ages. While the projects I've discussed here today aren't the only ones out there, they are certainly some major contenders, and I'm very eager to see how they all continue to develop as the months go by.\n\nThanks for joining me today on this trip into the Metaverse. This is my final article for 2021, so from myself and the team here at MSQ, thank you for all the support, and we can't wait to see you again in 2022! Happy New Year and much peace and goodwill to you and yours! Bye bye!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/16VaGEa.gif)\n\n*For updates on new NFT drops, NFT news, and more, make sure you follow [OurVillage](https://ourvillage.substack.com/) on SubStack, and don’t forget to follow [Farmer Joe](https://twitter.com/HelloFarmerJoe) and [Lumberjack Larry](https://twitter.com/LumberjackLar)* on Twitter.\n\n*Join the [MSQ Discord](https://discord.com/invite/d6Es4qRNAQ) and participate in weekly and holiday events when they become available!

From Monday to Friday we bring you some of the best projects the cryptosphere has to offer. From NFTs and DeFi to Blockchain games and the Metaverse, you’ll find it all right here on MSQ! Today we're taking a look at the biggest personalities in the NFT space and the impact they have had on it!***\n\n## Movers & Shakers\n\nIn the last year the NFT space has boomed. 2021 saw NFTs brought to the fore, and though there are many reasons for this, certain individuals have played a massive role in making this all a reality. In fact, according to NonFungible.com, a total of **$6,568,082,244.22** worth of NFT sales have been carried out over the course of the past year. *What!?* That's mind-boggling! So just who are the real movers and shakers within the NFT space for 2021? Let's find out!\n\n## Beeple\n\nWhere do we even start with this guy? [Beeple,](https://www.beeple-crap.com/) AKA Mike Winkelmann, is an American digital artist, graphic designer and animator. He is renown for his use of various mediums in creating comical, phantasmagoric works that typically lampoon modern sociopolitical developments while using figures from Pop Culture to further drive his point home. Beeple has directed numerous hard-hitting short films but is most famously known for his 'Everydays,' a collection consisting of pictures that are all completed from start to finish every single day. At the time of writing, Beeple is on a streak of 5,344 days! Impressive!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dAn8dCv.jpg)\n\n> Beeple AKA Mike Winkelmann\n\n![](youtube:hB6VQ82YyN0)\n\n> 'MANIFEST DESTINY' is one of Beeple's most compelling animated works\n\nNow let's talk about Beeple's impact on the NFT industry. This powerhouse of modern art broke into the NFT space earlier this year by selling an NFT in a first-of-its-kind auction at Christie’s for a whopping $69 million! This brought many people's attention to the NFT space and sparked curiosity and intrigue among audiences across the world. It also brought new perspective to countless embattled creatives and proved that it's entirely possible to make a living from NFTs and art.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/O5vEiAj.jpg)\n\n> Beeple’s collage, [Everydays: The First 5,000 Days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everydays:_the_First_5000_Days)\n\nBeeple continues to create groundbreaking NFT collections and recently made an appearance on '**The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon**.' In his interview, Beeple explains the origins of his name and breaks down how he went from a humble digital artist to selling NFTs for millions of dollars. This TV appearance is monumental since the potential and purpose of NFTs were explained in a simple and comprehensive manner for millions around the world, providing the masses with some insight into this fantastic technology and growing industry.\n\n![](youtube:AXC-_kWqZXo)\n\n> Beeple's appearance on **The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon**\n\n## GaryVee\n\nNext up we have the one and only [GaryVee.](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/) I'm sure Gary doesn't need any kind of introduction, but in case you don't know, Gary Vaynerchuk is a Belarusian-American entrepreneur, author, speaker, and Internet personality. He is a co-founder of the restaurant reservation software company [Resy](https://resy.com/) and [Empathy Wines](https://empathywines.com/) as well as a host of other endeavors.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZAptHBP.png)\n\n> Gary Vaynerchuk\n\nGaryVee has been talking about NFTs for months and months, and rightfully so! He even created his own NFT project called [VeeFriends](https://veefriends.com/) in order to build a community around his various passions using NFT technology and their smart contract capabilities. By owning a VeeFriend NFT, you immediately become part of the VeeFriends community and get access to VeeCon. VeeFriends is now one of the biggest NFT projects in the space.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xwqHcjQ.png)\n\nApart from VeeFriends, GaryVee talks about and posts a significant amount of content surrounding NFTs on his many social media channels. It's really quite amazing how influential he has become in this space. I recommend you visit his [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/garyvee) and socials if you'd like to find out more about NFTs as he explains them and the industry in simple terms so that anyone can learn about them.\n\nLastly, GaryVee hosts a show called 'DNA' (Discovering New Artists) via Twitter Spaces. As a serial entrepreneur, GaryVee believes the NFT space is a total game changer for artists—and he's not wrong. How does DNA work? It's a series hosted exclusively on Twitter Spaces that lasts approximately 30 minutes. For the first 15 minutes, GaryVee introduces listeners to an emerging artist that he is personally excited about or just thinks is doing something cool. GaryVee will get to know them and their art and center the discussion around them. Then for the second half, Gary will conduct a Q&A session concerning the overall NFT space and educate newcomers about it.\n\nSo like I said, if you want to learn more about NFTs, GaryVee is your guy!\n\n## Snoop Dogg\n\nYup, believe it or not, [S-N-Double-O-P D-O-Double-G-Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0dDKdFvpFo) is a major player in the NFT space! Snoop Dogg is a world famous American rapper, songwriter, media personality, actor, and entrepreneur. I was surprised when I saw that he of all people was interested in the space. When I first heard about him and NFTs, he claimed to run the popular NFT Twitter account [Cozomo de’ Medici](https://twitter.com/CozomoMedici). Is he really the personality behind it? I don't think anyone knows for sure. Anyway, he claims to be, so that's good enough for me!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f8QObe2.png)\n\n> Snoop Dogg\n\nIt's always great news when a big celebrity (especially one as popular as Snoop) endorses and talks about the NFT space as, once again, it opens the eyes of so many people to this ever-evolving and growing space. In a major turn of events, Snoop recently announced that he will be entering the Metaverse and have his own experience in [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/snoopdogg/) where he claims he will hold 'private Metaverse parties.' Sign me up!\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n![](twitter:snoopdogg/status/1441076327948316686)\n  \n</div>\n\n## Tying It All up\n\nThat's a wrap everyone! It's awesome to see the NFT space continuously growing and evolving as the months go by. These three personalities, among several others, have played an integral part in this growth by bringing it to the world outside the virtual realms of NFTs. We can only hope that more and more people will continue to explore and talk about the NFT space in the coming months and years so that eventually we see global adoption take place!\n\nIf you don't have a MSQ profile yet, make sure you sign up for one so that you're always first in line to receive the latest news and content we have to offer.

      "body": "***Greetings all and Happy New Year! Welcome to the first Discovery of the Day for 2022! From Monday to Friday we bring you some of our top picks from across the cryptosphere—from NFTs and Blockchain Games to DeFi and the Metaverse, you'll find it all right here on MSQ. Today we explore a topic you may have heard of but don't have too much understanding about...Will 2022 mark the Rise of Web 3.0? And what does that mean for all of us? Let's find out!***\n\n## The Internet and Interconnectedness\n\nThe internet has been around for a couple of decades now, and over time, it's evolved significantly. In the beginning we had **Web 1.0** in which there were very few content creators but many consumers of content. The core features of Web 1.0 are as follows:\n\n- Primarily personal, static pages\n- The server's file system serves content\n- Pages built using Server Side Includes or Common Gateway Interface (CGI)\n- Elements on a page are positioned and aligned using frames and tables\n\n*(Information sourced from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-1-0-web-2-0-and-web-3-0-with-their-difference/), 2021)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lmNowyy.png)\n\n> [The Lost World](http://www.lost-world.com/Lost_World02/inGENe.html) website is a perfect example of a Web 1.0 site - note the simple interface, basic information and limited design. You can check out more examples of Web 1.0 sites [here](https://gizmodo.com/23-ancient-web-sites-that-are-still-alive-5960831)\n\nSeveral years later, with the advancement of technology, improved line speeds and better methods of storing and securing data came **Web 2.0**. This is pretty much the internet as we know it today with social media sites such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon.com, Instagram and so forth. In the world of Web 2.0, users can watch videos, share thoughts, opinions and pictures, post blogs, run podcast, live stream and so forth. In many respects, Web 2.0 is simply an enhanced version of Web 1.0.\n\nWhile Web 2.0 is more social and has allowed for many more content creators to showcase their abilities, it is highly centralized and run by large media and tech companies that have their own agendas and interests at heart. In other words, if someone is deemed to violate any rules and regulations (which are subject to change at any time), then their ability to post content may be suspended, or they may be banned for life with little to no real warning. While this isn't always an issue, in numerous cases, the infractions are arbitrary, accidental or simply unjustified. This poses a huge risk for many content creators who rely heavily on their channels in order to earn a living.\n\nSome of the key features of Web 2.0 include:\n\n- Information is sorted freely, allowing users to fetch and categorize information as a collective\n- Content is more dynamic and intuitive, responding to the input of users\n- Info flows between the owners of the site and its users through active evaluation and online comments/posts\n- Developed APIs to permit self-usage, for example, via a software application\n- The internet is accessed by a wider variety of users with more nuanced needs than simple information and basic entertainment\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RBoVQtL.png)\n\n> You might use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home) regularly, or perhaps you're more of a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) fan? Regardless, Web 2.0 is all around you and is practically ubiquitous\n\n## What the Heck is Web 3.0?\n\nAnd now to the million (or maybe billion?) dollar question. Just what the heck is **'Web 3.0?'** Well that's a fairly complex question in reality, but to summarize, it's where instead of data being 'owned,' it's 'shared.' I think this is something of an oversimplification, because 'ownership' is central within the world of Web 3.0. Maybe a better way to look at it is that, data that *should* be shared is shared, and data that *should* be owned and kept safe/private does just that. Still a little too abstract? OK, how about, 'Data should do what it's supposed to and belong to the appropriate owners?' I don't think that's too far off...well, at least in my opinion.\n\nIn truth, Web 3.0 is still emerging. You could argue that it really started with the birth of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) back in 2008/2009 and the development of Blockchain technology. While many detractors have called it vaporware, a ponzi scheme and a number of other disparaging terms, Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies like [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) have shown time and again that they are serious endeavors with many developers and increasing amounts of capital behind them.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ud9Ih1l.png)\n\n> Heard this one for a couple of years now, haven't you anon?\n\nI'm not by any means saying that all crypto projects are great. Hardly. Some are downright terrible. But that goes for just about anything in life. Do I like every Metal band out there? No. Do I like every kind of pizza? As long as it doesn't have pineapple, then probably, but...no. All I'm trying to say here is that there will always be projects that do something better than others, or at the very least, will stand out more from the others because they're the original or most advanced or whatever. And that's also not to say that good projects will always be good or even the best...but that's the risk you take with anything, isn't it?\n\n### Wait, So What!?\n\nOK, but what has any of this got to do with Web 3.0, you ask? The main idea behind Blockchain and crypto is that it's decentralized, meaning that data can be securely accessed via a number of devices or sources. This means that, if there's an outage in one or more devices, others will be readily available and ensure that data is not compromised in any way, shape or form. If a site or network goes down and your ability to access your funds or data disappears, guess what? It isn't decentralized, and it certainly isn't Web 3.0.\n\nAnd just how many times has the Bitcoin Network [gone down](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-uptime/) since its inception? Well, here's the answer:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bqWF60v.png)\n\nAnd there you have it! It's been 3,219 days, at the time of writing, since Bitcoin last went down, and in total, Bitcoin has only been down for 14 hours and 47 minutes since January 3rd 2009 (heck, that's 13 years before this article's publication!) This equates to nearly 99.99% of uptime. Now that's impressive! Maybe you don't really consider Bitcoin Web 3.0, and while it's not perfect, it's certainly done a good job of remaining accessible and online for the vast majority of its lifespan (so far).\n\nThe reality is that crypto and Blockchain are cornerstones of Web 3.0, whether we know it or not. Web 3.0 cannot exist without Blockchain, and so many consider them to be synonymous. However, if Web 3.0 is still developing, then it helps to think of it in a slightly broader sense, at least for the time being. So exactly what are some of the elements that constitute Web 3.0 as it stands?\n\n## The Components of Web 3.0\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list, but other than decentralization and actual ownership, here are some other factors to take into account when looking at Web 3.0\n\n- **Semantic Web** - Without getting too technical, this means giving information well-defined meaning by extending definitions and altering the meaning of words based on their context. This involves improving technology so that keywords and numbers are replaced with something that interprets the meaning of terms and sentences\n- **Artificial Intelligence** - Here AI works with natural language processing to deliver more relevant and accurate results in a much more efficient and intuitive way. It could also mean streamlining processes carried out on the Web so they are faster, more secure and more efficient\n- **3D Graphics** - This may very well refer directly to the Metaverse and Blockchain Games, but essentially the 3D experience will be a major feature in Web 3.0. You'll be able to walk through art exhibitions or museums and interact with visitors and guides in real-time, providing for an immersive and engaging experience\n- **Greater Connectivity** - With information becoming more interconnected and readily available, and line speeds becoming faster and more reliable, the capacities of users to engage in a number of different activities increases substantially. It also means that the internet becomes more Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and significantly less centralized\n- **Ubiquity** - Content can be accessed via multiple devices and applications, and virtually every device is connected to the internet. This is what you might consider the Internet of Things (IoT) which will allow for devices to collect, transmit and process data in real-time regardless of where they are in the world\n\n*(Information sourced from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-1-0-web-2-0-and-web-3-0-with-their-difference/), 2021)*\n\nThis isn't where Web 3.0 ends by any means. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are already a global phenomenon, providing creators and communities with the ability to bring their content and ideas to life over an extended period of time. NFTs give creators and those that support them the ability to create sustainable economies that encourage participation, communication and innovation. Blockchain games promise to provide gamers with greater ownership over their in-game assets and the ability to earn rewards based on their participation, skill and financial savvy. In truth many of these projects are still in their early stages of development, and while not all of them will make it in the long run, those that do will almost certainly change the lives of those that supported them.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6SSsP4C.png)\n\n> Nonfungible.com details just how well the top NFT-based Blockchain projects are performing\n\n## What's the Takeaway?\n\nI think the main thing to understand here is that you're still early to the party. 2022 promises to be an extremely exciting year for crypto with current projects ramping up their development and new ambitious projects entering the scene. Web 3.0 is here, but it's far from mass adoption. As long as people remain skeptical of the technology or why they should move away from existing platforms, it's safe to assume that you're still early to the party. Once the majority understands how important data integrity, autonomy and mutual benefits are, then mass adoption will take place, and Web 3.0 will officially be here.\n\nAnd that does it for the first Discovery of the Day for 2022.

MSQ recently moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can sign up for a profile and explore all the site has to offer. From Monday to Friday we bring you some of the best projects from across the cryptosphere. Whether it's NFTs, the Metaverse or Blockchain games, you'll find it all right here on MSQ! Today we present a project that started off the New Year with a bang! Let's take a closer look at Alien Frens!***\n\n## Set Your Phasers to Fun!\n\nAstronomers estimate that 40 billion Earth-like planets could exist in our very own [Milky Way.](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way) 40 billion Earth-like planets, and you're telling me humans are the only forms of intelligent life in the universe? Yeah, right! While we may not have discovered aliens *yet*, we've certainly seen our fair share of aliens in the Metaverse. First we had a close encounter with [Lonely Alien Space Club](https://lonelyaliens.com/), and a little while later, we made contact with the [The Alien Boys.](https://twitter.com/TheAlienBoyNFT) This time around, with their spaceship making a hype-fueled crash-landing into the NFT space, we have discovered [Alien Frens!](https://alienfrens.io/)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5iAiYuu.gif)\n\nAlien Frens is a community-driven collection of 10,000 awesome Aliens exploring the vast reaches of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) Blockchain. Their goal is to build the biggest group of frens in the Metaverse. However, Alien Frens is more than just your standard profile picture project. Minting an Alien Fren gets you 1 amazingly unique PFP, a ticket to all their events, access to invasions, a gnarly 30-page comic book, exclusive rights to the artwork, early access to merch, and a pass to any of the things announced in their Roadmap. I think it's safe to say that there's plenty of utility to be found here!\n\n### Rarity\n\nAlien Frens are made up of four rarities, namely **Xenos, Femi, Lochias** and **Olu**, each of which can be differentiated by color:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Dlgc49N.png)\n\nThe rarer factions determine the amount of payload holders will have for prizes that are picked up in invasions on the way back to Planet Fren! Prizes include anything from [Cool Cats](https://www.coolcatsnft.com/) NFTs to crypto or even new UFOs for your Fren! Isn't that awesome!?\n\n### Alien Showcase\n\nThe creator of these lovable aliens goes by the name of [Mason Crowe](https://twitter.com/_masoncrowe), a 2D/3D artist who resides in California, USA. His ultimate aim is to build the biggest group of Frens in the Metaverse, and in case you couldn't tell, he's a big fan of aliens 👽\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZH0Ma5S.png)\n\nNow without further ado, let's take a look at a few of these charming Frens...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KFFqx3R.png)\n\n> James Bond Fren was a better secret agent than a snake charmer...\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rE4pnSL.png)\n\n> *Insert Pikachu WOW meme here*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/svpBJeJ.png)\n\n> 'I choose you!'\n\n## What's in the Next Galaxy for Alien Frens?\n\nThe Alien Frens project only launched recently. At present, they're working through their launch Roadmap which includes items like invasion events, real-life events, merchandise drops, the launch of the $FRENS token and much more. After this initial Roadmap is completed, the Frens will release all the deets concerning Roadmap 2.0! Feast your eyes on the current Alien Frens Roadmap below:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3KZ1pMD.png)\n\n> You can view the current Roadmap in its original form [here](https://alienfrens.io/)\n\n## Extraterrestrial Stats\n\nThe Alien Frens collection is sold out, but you can still grab yourself one (or maybe even a few?) of these exquisite ETs over on the project's [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/alienfrensnft) page. Now let's take a brief look at a couple of stats, shall we?\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\n\n- **Total Items** - 10K\n- **Owners** - 5.7K\n\nThe clean and original art style along with some great utility makes Alien Frens a truly special project. I highly recommend you follow them on their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alienfrens) and join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/alienfrens) so that you can interact with the existing community and find out about all the latest developments regarding the project.\n\nAnd so we've reached the end of this epic little exploration. Pretty cool right? If you don't have a MSQ profile yet, make sure you sign up for one so that you receive all the latest news and can check out all the site has to offer. And don't forget to tell all your friends and family to sign up too!

MSQ recently moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can sign up for a profile and explore all the site has to offer.

Today we're covering...Lost Boy!**_\n\n## Get Lo$t Together\n\nTo be a lostboy or lostgirl is to be an accidental paradox. Their harshest critics and loudest supporters, they appear fully confident but work overtime to quiet their insecurities and calm their chronic dissatisfaction through relentless self-reflection.\n\nThey are the dreamers. Pessimistic optimists. Always hopeful but quickly dragged down by external negativity.\n\nThey navigate the day-to-day with both feet on the ground and their heads in the clouds. They’re the extroverted introverts, surrounded by many but forever lost in their own minds...\n\nThe mission of the [Lost Boy](https://lostboy.io/) project is to create a community of people who have picked themselves up more times than they can count and come out stronger every single time. _Lost Boy_ and [Lost Girl](https://opensea.io/collection/lostgirl-nft) NFTs are a shared icon of strength, a signifier that all share the same language—the language of survivors and dreamers, even when they feel like they’re battling on their own.\n\n> Our goal is to develop an echo chamber that acts as a virtual safe space - a judgment-free zone where there’s a multitude of people who want to listen to each other’s struggles. A space where you may find guidance, and you might find comfort, but will always find the freedom to express yourself\n\nGet Lo$t Together ✊\n\n## Lost & Found\n\n_Lost Boy_ is a sold-out collection of 10,000 ERC-721 NFTs _'randomly born'_ on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) Blockchain and stored via [IPFS](https://ipfs.io). Recently released is also _Lost Girl_, an additional collection of 10,000 NFTs which can be claimed by _Lost Boy_ holders. Each lostboy or lostgirl has one combination of over 3 million, making each of them unique in their own way. To top it all off, every piece includes an original song to make things even more special. And if that's not already impressive enough, holders will soon be able to stake their pieces to receive $LOST, an ERC-20 token that will further drive the project's ecosystem and be redeemable for future drops and rare merch.\n\n![](youtube:eJ-mccTlCP0)\n\n![](youtube:gGSN-L2ytdY)\n\n## Music to my Ears 🎵\n\nOn top of every NFT coming with an entirely unique LoFi beat, you can also chill to the LOSTBOY LoFi playlist via [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/5QtUIFWhk782TvSAAsXVrM) or [Audius](https://audius.co/lostboy) 😎\n\n<div align=\"center\"><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/5QtUIFWhk782TvSAAsXVrM\" width=\"350\" height=\"400\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" style=\"border: none;\"></iframe></div>\n\n<br>\n\n<div align=\"center\"><iframe src=\"https://audius.co/embed/playlist/eJRNp?flavor=card\" width=\"350\" height=\"400\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" style=\"border: none;\"></iframe></div>\n\n## 'Balloon' 🎈 (Coming Soon!)\n\nLost Boy's Meditation & Mindfulness App, **Balloon**, will soon be made available exclusively to holders and will be an ongoing project that'll have content updated regularly. The app's initial version will start with three basic meditation programs, a daily diary, and an emotion tracker. The community will dictate the future updates of the app.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n![](twitter:lostboyNFT/status/1478432308692754435)\n\n</div>\n\n## Earn $LOST\n\n<div style=\"width: 25%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/6wCK2MQ/token.png)\n\n</div>\n\n$LOST is a soon-to-be-released ERC-20 token that can be earned by staking lostboys. Additionally, staking lostgirls will act as a $LOST multiplier. This is a critical step moving forward and will help drive the growing ecosystem by allowing holders to redeem $LOST in exchange for things like rare vinyls, cassettes, 3D lostboys, and more.\n\nThe beats don't stop there though. Lost Boy founder, [offrami](https://twitter.com/offrami) (currently signed to [Spinnin Records](https://spinninrecords.com)), understands the power of music and collaboration. $LOST will further be redeemable for sample packs geared towards professional artists, producers, and content creators. As a music buff, this is something I was very excited to learn about. It's a deceptively powerful step towards the decentralization of the independent art and music creation economy promised by NFT and Blockchain technology, and it's projects like Lost Boy that push that needle forward.\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center;\">\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/wQZTDxs/staking-teaser.png)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center;\">\n\nLost Boy $taking Sneak Peek\n\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n> Staking will soon be made available via the [LostBoy.io](https://lostboy.io) website\n\n## The Team\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/8jPSxNZ/Lost-Girls.png)\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center;\">\n\n[RAMI](https://twitter.com/offrami)<br>**Artist/Dreamer**<br><br>\n[YOUSSEF](https://twitter.com/gallops_)<br>**Engineer/Builder/Streamer**<br>\n\n</div>\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/DDFkcJ2/Lost-Boys.png)\n\n## Stats\n\nAll 10,000 Lost Boy NFTs have been minted, but you can still find them on the secondary market via [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/lostboy-nft).\n\n**Smart Contract** - [0xc1a1e381389cb927f1d57511e144b644ef0c6385](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc1a1e381389cb927f1d57511e144b644ef0c6385)\n\n_Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information._\n\n[Lost Boy NFTs](https://opensea.io/collection/lostboy-nft)\n\n  * **Available Items** - 10K\n  * **Owners** - 3.7K\n\n[Lost Girl NFTs](https://opensea.io/collection/lostgirl-nft)\n\n  * **Available Items** - 1.5K\n  * **Owners** - 591\n\nThere is so much more to this project—including limited edition vinyls and merch—that we didn't cover today.

      "body": "***Greetings everyone! It's time for another unforgettable Discovery of the Day! MSQ recently moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can sign up for a profile and enjoy all the site has to offer. From Monday to Friday we bring you our Discovery of the Day. Whether it's NFTs, Blockchain Games or the Metaverse, you can find it all right here on MSQ! Today we take a closer look at a project combining high-paced combat with giant mechs...it's Phantom Galaxies!***\n\n## From Space Invaders to Open-World Exploration\n\nGaming has really come a long way in the last few decades. I remember waking up as a kid to play video games like Contra, Battle City and [Space Invaders.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) The gameplay was simple and the graphics were basic, but regardless, these classic games provided me with countless hours of entertainment. As I grew up, games became better looking and more complex in nature. Some of my favorites include [Half-Life,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)) Warcraft III, F.E.A.R and [Dead Space.](https://www.ea.com/games/dead-space) In truth there are countless games worthy of praise that I've left out here, but these are just a few of the standouts from my youth.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Pw4w6qG/Isaac-Clarke.gif)\n\n> These sorts of moments in games make you feel like a real badass...\n\nThe gaming industry continues to grow, and with the rise of Web 3.0 and Blockchain technology, there are numerous projects all vying to incorporate NFTs and player-based economies into their offerings. We've already taken a look at several space themed Blockchain games here on MSQ—[Star Atlas,](https://staratlas.com/) [Starl](https://www.starltoken.com/) and [Frontier](https://www.missingfrontier.com/) are just a few we've covered, and just a few weeks ago, I did an end-of-year overview of all of these.\n\n> Check out my MSQ article: [NFTs in Space - Star Atlas, Starl & Frontier](https://MSQ.io/blog/nfts-in-space-star-atlas-starl-frontier)\n\nToday's Discovery takes a deeper look into a similarly themed project, albeit with its own mechanics and approach to Blockchain gaming. Let's get into it!\n\n## Setting the Scene\n\n> Fifty years after the last Great War between the Union and the Commonwealth of Neoterra, these two rival factions find themselves forced into an uneasy alliance in order to combat a dangerous new threat—the Sha'Kari.\n>\n> As the priest caste of the Sha'Har race, the Sha'Kari Zealots seek vengeance upon humanity for desecrating the Sha'Har's ancestral planets. As such, they have a formidable presence in the galaxy and span several star systems. It is for this reason that the Union and the Commonwealth must stand together if they ever hope to succeed against the Sha'Kari.\n>\n> The Sha'Kari have the technological advantage, having created the original powered armors that served as the inspiration for humans to build their highly successful Mechanized Starfighters.\n>\n> As the best pilots in the fleet, Ranger Squad is universally recognized as the most fearless and effective Mechanized Starfighter unit in the Union and Commonwealth Alliance.\n>\n> The journey will not be an easy one. Only through cooperation and careful strategy will humanity ever prevail over their alien foes.\n\n### Bringing the Battle to Them\n\n[Phantom Galaxies](https://phantomgalaxies.com/) is an open-world Blockchain-based space sim that combines intense mechanized warfare with an epic storyline. Players will be able to choose from 1 of 4 transforming Mecha Starfighters to suit their unique style of play:\n\n- Lancer\n- Buster\n- Assault, and\n- Breacher\n\nPlayers will pilot their mech from a third-person perspective, and judging by the game's mechanics, it plays just like traditional 3D Action RPGs (ARPGs) that gamers from all over are already familiar with. However, Phantom Galaxies differs in that players will be able to own and control their in-game assets, such as mechs, equipment, avatars and game currency, thanks to the incorporation of NFTs.\n\nIn essence, Phantom Galaxies aspires to be the leading multichain Sci-Fi mecha shared world online ARPG (now that's a mouthful!) The intention is to provide the most in-depth and engaging PC and console gaming experience possible through the integration of Blockchain tech and player-driven governance. Phantom Galaxies' multichain framework will ensure that millions of players and a huge range of project collaborations will coexist within the same Metaverse. Now take a breather and check out their epic trailer!\n\n![](youtube:H8-ZXXaOITg)\n\n## Focusing on the Prize\n\nA lot of projects are still in development with very few have working demos available to try out. Even then, the majority of Alphas and Betas in the Blockchain gaming and Metaverse space feel underdeveloped and tacky. The same cannot be said for Phantom Galaxies. In late December of 2021, they released their Closed Alpha to a select few individuals who were in possession of 'The Halberd-001' NFT. Now I don't know about you, but judging by the gameplay and graphics in this Tweet, this looks closer to a final product than an Alpha version:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    \n![](twitter:NinongAid/status/1473889286491541504)\n\n</div>\n\nNow if this is where the game is already, I can only imagine that the finished product will be nothing short of spectacular! Seeing a trailer and getting to view gameplay is certainly reassuring and bodes well for Phantom Galaxies and its supporters. Combat seems to be slick and fast-paced, and the graphics are on par with a lot of AAA games. I'm actually pretty disappointed I didn't get to try out the Alpha!\n\nPhantom Galaxies has garnered a lot of support since it already has a product that they've proven exists. Moreover, it looks great and seems to play really well to boot. Although it has a lot in the pipeline, Phantom Galaxies has demonstrated good faith with their audience and definitively put their stamp on the Blockchain gaming and Metaverse space. Awesome stuff!\n\n## So How Does it Work?\n\nHaving perused the Phantom Galaxies [Litepaper v1.0](https://phantomgalaxies.com/BFS%20Phantom%20Galaxies%20Litepaper%20v1.0.pdf), the game will work pretty much as follows:\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/9ZrxrVR/Core-Game-Loop.png)\n\nSo you'll buy (or upgrade) a Starfighter Mech, explore the universe of Phantom Galaxies playing various missions and finding new locations, earn tokens through one or more activities, and then stake or spend those tokens on items, property and so forth. Thereafter the process begins again. Not really too difficult if you think about it, but in a project this ambitious, you can be sure that it's a *little* more involved than that.\n\nA core part of Phantom Galaxies will be buying and upgrading a Starfighter Mech. There are several different components of a mech that can be upgraded or augmented including:\n\n- Frame\n- Reactor\n- Shields\n- Cargohold\n- Thrusters\n- Overheat Capacity\n- Weapon Slots\n- Armor Bonus\n- And more...\n\nI think you get the idea. Basically each of these components provides a certain advantage for your Mech. A stronger Frame means more durability in combat while a bigger Cargohold will allow you to gather and store more items, for example. In this way players will need to carefully strategize and determine exactly how to upgrade their Mech(s) so that they get the maximum possible benefit. Of course, this is easier said than done, but those players who really master this mechanic will almost certainly reap the rewards.\n\n### Player Activities\n\nPlayers will be able to engage in a number of different activities within the Phantom Galaxies Universe:\n\n- **Missions** - These form part of the story of Phantom Galaxies and will reveal more about the characters and universe. Missions are sequential in nature and will ultimately determine the development of the game's lore\n- **Quests** - These are standalone events and/or stories that will explore more minor characters and allow players to enjoy different kinds of gameplay scenarios\n- **Operations** - These are objectives that will keep players busy on a daily and/or weekly basis. Those players that complete these will be rewarded accordingly\n- **Raids** - Intended for advanced players and teams of experienced individuals, Raids will require groups to participate in various Player Versus Environment (PvE) scenarios that represent the biggest challenges within Phantom Galaxies. Only those players who communicate well and work together effectively will be able to prevail in Raids\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/qN7MJ5f/Mech.png)\n\n## What's in the Team's Sites?\n\nThe first Phantom Galaxies Roadmap outlines the various activities that will be undertaken throughout the first three quarters of 2022. Q1 includes Completion Badge NFT Claims and Player-Owned Planets while Q2 details Origin Series Starfighters and Origin Series Generative Avatars. Later, in Q3, an Early Access Game Launch is planned:\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/jrkTdnG/Roadmap.png)\n\n### More Important Info\n\nThere's a whole bunch to unpack with Phantom Galaxies, so here's a brief summary of what else you can expect from this epic project:\n\n**Items**\n\n> In-game items will exist as NFTs and will include things like Weapons, Armor, Shaders, and Consumables. Players can purchase items from shops or find them as loot throughout the Phantom Galaxies universe.\n\n**Star Systems**\n\n> Phantom Galaxies’ numerous star systems will offer players a ton of planets to explore as well as challenges to overcome and resources to exploit.\n> \n> Outer star systems are way more dangerous and populated by the most dangerous NPC factions and player Organizations. However, the loot and rewards that can be found in Outer Systems will be some of the rarest and most coveted loot imaginable.\n>\n> Core star systems will provide players with a safe environment for all types of activities and contain primarily PvE content.\n\n**Starfighter Destruction**\n\n> When a Starfighter is destroyed, its Durability will drop, but as long as Durability remains above 0, the Starfighter can respawn and be used as normal. Durability can be repaired by spending resources.\n> \n> If a Starfighter is destroyed and its Durability falls below 0, it will be locked and unusable until a cooldown period has expired. Insurance policies can be purchased by players so that the cooldown period is reduced.\n\n**Property Ownership**\n\n> Players can purchase and own property within Phantom Galaxies. Various properties in different sizes will be available and include space stations for individual players and planetary bases for large Organizations.\n>\n> Each property will have specific coordinates and a location within the Phantom Galaxies map. Property owners can build numerous types of structures including factories and refining plants. Property Owners will be required to pay rent to Phantom Galaxies.\n\nThere's plenty I haven't covered, but other features include:\n\n- A Token Economy\n- Player-Owned Planets\n- Organizations\n- A Multichain Multiverse\n- A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)\n- And more...\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/pKftQSV/In-Game-1.jpg)\n\n> To find out more about the mechanics and inner workings of Phantom Galaxies, check out their [Litepaper v1.0](https://phantomgalaxies.com/BFS%20Phantom%20Galaxies%20Litepaper%20v1.0.pdf)\n\n## Turbo Charged Stats\n\nPhantom Galaxies is just getting started, but their Origin Collection can be viewed and purchased over on their [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/phantom-galaxies-origin-collection) page. Now let's see those stats!\n\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\n\n- **Total Items** - 2\n- **Owners** - 552.1K\n\nPhantom Galaxies is a massive undertaking with a serious team and rapidly expanding community.

      "body": "***Happy New Year MSQ friends! It's time for another incredible Discovery of the Day! MSQ recently moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can sign up for a profile and explore all the site has to offer. From Monday to Friday we bring you some of the best projects from across the cryptosphere. Whether it's NFTs, the Metaverse or Blockchain games, you'll find it all right here on MSQ! Today we present a Blockchain game that's due for release later this year! So without further ado, let's take a closer look at...Guild of Guardians!***\r\n\r\n## The Course of Blockchain Gaming in 2022\r\n\r\n2021 saw Blockchain gaming gain huge popularity with games like [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/) and [Blankos Block Party](https://blankos.com/) allowing players to *truly* own their in-game assets and earn crypto and NFTs while gaming! It's really something to marvel at, and I think it's safe to say that 2022 is going to be an even bigger year for Blockchain gaming.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Blockchain gaming is inevitable—once players realize that they can earn rewards while playing and truly own their in-game assets, the gaming space will almost certainly be dominated by Blockchain-based endeavors.\r\n\r\nEvery year players spend tens of billions on in-game items, skins, cosmetics, you name it...but the problem is—they don't actually own *any* of these items. That's pretty darn unfair if you ask me. Gamers should be able to sell and trade their in-game assets for real money, and this, my friends, is where the revolutionary upcoming game, [Guild of Guardians,](https://www.guildofguardians.com/) comes into play...\r\n\r\n![](https://i.ibb.co/TkVMzFw/Knight-Arrow.jpg)\r\n\r\n> Sometimes melee units get the short end of the arrow...\r\n\r\n## Join a Guild and Battle On!\r\n\r\nGuild of Guardians is a mobile RPG where players can turn their passion for gaming into assets. GoG is a multiplayer, fantasy, action RPG in which players build their dream team of ‘Guardians’ and compete in a guild to earn epic, tradeable rewards. Oh, and did I forget to mention that it's *free* to play!? Well, it totally is!\r\n\r\nWithin the game, you will be able to:\r\n\r\n- Explore a rich world of dungeons, magic, orcs, elves, and more\r\n- Own your loot for real, forever\r\n- Trade any item to other players and\r\n- Play with friends, working together to take down tough bosses\r\n\r\nAs the game grows, the developers plan to add more gameplay modes and features such as Guild Raids, Guild PvP, Land gameplay, User-generated dungeons, Global eSports tournaments and even social hang-out and trading zones. Sounds like a lot of fun to me!\r\n\r\nThe game is built on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain with unique ERC-721s (NFTs) serving as in-game assets. The team is also making use of [Immutable X,](https://www.immutable.com/) the first Layer 2 for NFTs on Ethereum, ensuring zero gas fees and instant trades for players. Guild of Guardians will not be pay-to-win since skill and strategy are the core elements of the game. In addition, spending money on Guild of Guardians won’t come at the expense of other players because the game is not focused on PvP.\r\n\r\nNow all this doesn't mean that GoG will be a walk in the park, but it does ensure that everyone experiences the game in a universal and enjoyable way. In essence, the playing field will be evened out, so everyone's experience should, at the very least, be comparable.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/timK5wx.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Heroes\r\n\r\nHeroes are unique characters that players will use in Dungeons to defeat monsters and collect rewards. As a player, you will have to formulate your own strategy and customize your team of heroes based on your individual playstyle.\r\n\r\nEach hero will possess a unique set of properties that determine its particular playstyle as well as its strengths and weaknesses. Players can form their dream team of heroes and choose how they want to play and specialize. In other words, there will be heroes and synergies for everyone to choose from.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jjL02IU.png)\r\n\r\n## GOG Token\r\n\r\n$GOG is the native token that will be used within the Guild of Guardians mobile game. 350 million tokens will be set aside in a rewards pool that distributes Gems to players depending on qualifying game behaviors such as Playtime, Account Level/Character Progression, Completion of Quests and more. This is where the Play-and-Earn aspect really becomes apparent.\r\n\r\nGuild of Guardians will be published by Immutable and developed by [Stepico](https://stepico.com/). Immutable is one of the world’s largest VC-funded Blockchain gaming start-ups, backed by investors such as Naspers and Galaxy Digital. Stepico is a mobile games development studio with a team of over 50 developers and artists who have worked on AAA-quality strategy and RPG games with over 5 million installs. In short: Guild of Guardians is totally legit!\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EUjTOQy.jpg)\r\n\r\n## What's Planned for Guild of Guardians?\r\n\r\nGuild of Guardians isn't playable yet as they're in their first stage of release where players can start collecting Founders Heroes. As such, the game is expected to release sometime in early 2022. To quench your thirst, take a gander at some of this Pre-Alpha footage!\r\n\r\n![](youtube:FTwX0MX4YdE)\r\n\r\n## Prepare for Battle!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Guild of Guardians hasn't been released yet, and their presale for Founder Edition Heroes is already over. However, you can still find some of these over on [Immutable X](https://market.x.immutable.com/assets?collection=0xee972ad3b8ac062de2e4d5e6ea4a37e36c849a11) and [TokenTrove](https://tokentrove.com/collection/GuildOfGuardians)\r\n\r\nThe polished art style along with a host of cool features makes Guild of Guardians a truly awesome project. I highly recommend you follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GuildOfGuardian) and join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gog) so that you can receive all the latest updates and find out about upcoming Mints as and when they are announced.\r\n\r\nWell, that's it for today's journey.

MSQ recently moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can now sign up for a profile and explore the site in all its glory. From Monday to Friday we bring you our Discovery of the Day series—whether it's NFTs, Blockchain gaming or the metaverse, you'll find out all about it right here on MSQ! In today's edition we take a look at an awesome metaverse project that has everything to do with, well, you! Without further ado, we proudly present...Ready Player Me!***\r\n\r\n## Your Digital Identity\r\n\r\nIdentity is a big deal. Our lives revolve around the concept of a 'self' with its own values, morals, beliefs, desires and experiences. In all honesty, identity is practically everything that pertains to us—from the company we keep to the music we listen to and the way we style our hair to our little idiosyncrasies, there is very little within our lives that falls outside of the scope of identity.\r\n\r\nIdentity can even be stolen, misused and/or completely fabricated, and in the age of the internet, it's arguably easier than ever before. How many times have you read about someone who believed they were involved in a whirlwind romance with some millionaire living in an exotic location who 'just needed some help' with legal issues pertaining to the release of funds or something? So many vulnerable people, enamored with the idea of being loved by someone so extraordinary, send hundreds or even thousands of dollars to help their stricken lovers, only to later learn they were nothing more than a victim of an elaborate, yet all too common, scam.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wkX3zZW.gif)\r\n\r\nIdentity has and always will be a big deal. It's actually going to become more and more important, and now with the prospect of the metaverse and countless intertwined virtual worlds, having some kind of discernible identity, at least in my opinion, is of crucial importance. You need an ID to prove that you are who you say you are, and you need a passport if you want to travel to other countries. Now extrapolate this in a virtual world where there will be hundreds or even thousands of interconnected virtual spaces. Seems a bit intimidating, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nNo need to fear...there is an answer!\r\n\r\n## One Avatar, Unlimited Possibilities\r\n\r\nHow do you get a verified digital identity that can be used across the length and breadth of the metaverse? Why, you visit [Ready Player Me,](https://readyplayer.me/) a cross-game avatar platform for the metaverse of course! There's actually nothing complex about the concept behind *Ready Player Me* at all, and that's why it's so brilliant. Simply put, the avatar you create in *Ready Player Me* serves as your passport to the metaverse. Can you imagine having to create a new avatar every single time you enter a new Blockchain game or metaverse experience? Sounds like a major buzzkill to me! Nope, just a few minutes of your time is all it takes, literally once, and you have the ability to explore the metaverse virtually (see what I did there?) uninhibited!\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PVjLjM0.png)\r\n\r\n> Can we choose our own titles? I promise I'll be modest...\r\n\r\nIf you believe one company or entity will control the metaverse, well...you're missing the point. See, metaverse isn't 'Universe'—it's *Multiverse.* That means there will be many different individuals, companies, communities and so on that will make up the metaverse...we're talking about the culmination of everything digital into one massive interconnected experience! This is no small undertaking, and it's pretty much going to take *everyone* in order to make it happen. Moreover, there are a lot of factors to take into account with identity arguably being one of the top priorities for any would-be citizen of the metaverse.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bg2gSAw.gif)\r\n\r\n> Yeah, this is literally what we're talking about here! Hell yeah!\r\n\r\n## And What About Uptake?\r\n\r\nSo if *Ready Player Me* wants to be taken seriously, it'll have to be adopted by several platforms and developers, right? That sounds like a pretty big task to me, but from the looks of things, the team behind RPM are already enjoying a lot of attention and uptake from developers across the board. In fact, *Ready Player Me's* avatars are already being used in well over 1,100 apps and games on VR, mobile, desktop and the web. Some names include [SideQuest,](https://sidequestvr.com/) [VRChat,](https://hello.vrchat.com/) and [Animaze.](https://www.animaze.us/)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CadP1H2.png)\r\n\r\n> There are plenty of reputable names using and/or partnered with RPM, and you can see them all [here](https://readyplayer.me/apps)\r\n\r\nYup, the number of apps and developers integrating *Ready Player Me* into their offerings is practically rising by the day. The best part about all this is that integration can take place rapidly and is typically completed before 24 hours have elapsed. Oh, and did I mention there's no charge? Yup, *Ready Player Me* allows developers to take what they've painstakingly created over an eight year period and use it completely free of charge. Now how can anyone say no to that!?\r\n\r\n## So How Do You Create an Avatar?\r\n\r\nYou can be sure that the process is as simple and straightforward as possible. There are basically three steps:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AUXO3mJ.png)\r\n\r\n> **Step 1: Take a selfie** (alternatively, start from scratch)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vYu46vb.png)\r\n\r\n> **Step 2: Customize your avatar**\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/awVS2LT.png)\r\n\r\n> **Step 3: Export your avatar**\r\n\r\nAnd that's it. How easy is that? Go ahead and create your own RPM avatar right now by clicking [here.](https://readyplayer.me/avatar) In just a few minutes, you can have your own custom-made avatar that's ready to be deployed for use in the metaverse! Now that's some seriously cool stuff!\r\n\r\n## How Do I Find Out More?\r\n\r\nIf you really like the sound of Ready Player Me, you'll definitely want to check out their [official website.](https://readyplayer.me/) They also have a bunch of articles they've released pertaining to the metaverse, Ready Player Me and avatars on their [Blog](https://blog.readyplayer.me/) page.

MSQ recently moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can sign up for a profile and explore all the site has to offer. From Monday to Friday we bring you some of the best projects from across the cryptosphere. Whether it's NFTs, the Metaverse or Blockchain games, you'll find it all right here on MSQ! Today we take a look at an NFT project that celebrates some of the most important people in the world—women! And so we are proud to present...Crypto.Chicks!***\r\n\r\n## Women in the World of the Non-Fungible\r\n\r\nHumans are a pretty impressive species, but where would we be without the women in our lives? From the male perspective, women fulfill many roles such as mother, wife, daughter, girlfriend, sister and so on. But in reality, women are so much more than their often reductive and limiting gender roles—they are thinkers, creators, athletes, artists, scientists, engineers, humanitarians, philosophers and revolutionaries. Despite their contributions and critical role within society, they are often subject to unfair living and working conditions as well as a host of other forms of mistreatment and abuse.\r\n\r\nWhile much progress has been made, there are still many women who live within oppressive patriarchal structures. Since such constructs receive a sort of immunity under the guise of 'culture' and 'tradition,' they are, more often that not, nigh indestructible. However, women are harnessing the power of communities and technology to challenge these male-instituted hegemonies and finding innovative ways to provide relief to those who so direly require it.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Fq6EqQs.jpg)\r\n\r\n> [Mary Wollstonecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Wollstonecraft) challenged preconceived notions regarding women throughout the 18th century\r\n\r\nIn the last few months, the NFT space has seen some brilliant women-only collections that showcase some truly astounding art. Moreover, these projects are making real strides in helping empower women all over the world. It goes without saying that we're ecstatic to dive into detail about another collection that's making some serious waves and bringing something unique that ultimately changes the NFT space for the better: [Crypto.Chicks.](https://www.cryptochicks.app/)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AolZ0Zx.jpg)\r\n\r\n> Women-Only NFT Avatar Collections of 2021\r\n\r\n## Onwards and Upwards!\r\n\r\nCrypto.Chicks is the second generation of the [Crypto.Chicks 1/1,](https://opensea.io/collection/crypto-chick-3) the OG collection whose historical significance in the NFT space cannot be understated since it is the first all-women PFP collection to be created. [Polly,](https://twitter.com/MsPolly11) the project's lead artist, created the collection back in May 2021 after identifying a huge disparity in how women were represented in crypto and NFTs. The project was created to highlight the importance of women in the crypto space and reflects the individuality and uniqueness of each and every woman. As such, it is a collection of 10,000 empowering and unique PFPs on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain.\r\n\r\nCrypto.Chicks celebrates women from all backgrounds with different skin colors, hairstyles, fashion senses, makeup, personalities and so on. The female identity is diverse and nuanced, and so Crypto.Chicks does its utmost to ensure that all cultures and identities are represented within their collection.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OOdTrh8.gif)\r\n\r\n> Beautiful and bold, Crypto.Chicks represents women from all over\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most impressive aspect regarding Crypto.Chicks is that it isn't just another PFP project—it is a piece of history. The long term vision for Crypto.Chicks is to establish a brand that acts as the conduit for traditional retail and fashion companies to enter the metaverse. At present, the team are actively exploring opportunities and partnerships with 3D artists and fashion brands to create co-designed clothing, shoes, accessories and so forth. On top of this, the team are working to build a strong global network in order to host global meetups and events that will bring everyone together.\r\n\r\nCrypto.Chicks is also serious about art and culture. As a direct result, they are supporting creatives all over the world by running an art contest with a cash prize of $5,000! In addition, they plan to feature a monthly artist spotlight that will showcase female NFT artists from around the world along with interviews that tell their unique stories and explore their body of work. Very nice!\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KlZyZsT.png)\r\n\r\nIt should come as no surprise that Crypto.Chicks is an ardent advocate of women’s rights. For this reason, the project supports charities that work to enshrine and protect the rights of women and assist them with improving their socioeconomic circumstances. In due course, Crypto.Chicks will make a generous donation of 5 ETH to a selected charity as nominated by the project's community. Now that really is worth of praise!\r\n\r\n## The Path Ahead for Crypto.Chicks\r\n\r\nWe're not finished just yet! The Crypto.Chicks team has a jam-packed 2022 ahead of them with Roadmap items like staking, digital wearables for the metaverse, corporate partnerships and much more all due to be fulfilled within the first quarter. You can view a summary of their current Roadmap below 👇\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5ApiyOB.png)\r\n\r\n> You can view the Crypto.Chicks Roadmap in full [here](https://www.cryptochicks.app/#roadmap)\r\n\r\n## Empowering Stats\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the Crypto.Chicks collection is sold out, but you can still pick up one or more of these fantastic Chicks over on the project's [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/the-crypto-chicks) page. And now a quick look at a couple of stats:\r\n\r\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\r\n\r\n* **Total Items** - 10K\r\n* **Owners** - 3.6K\r\n\r\nThe slick art style, active and engaged team and growing community makes Crypto.Chicks an NFT project worthy of recognition and respect. I highly recommend you follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Crypto__Chicks) and join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/K3jP92MFk6) so that you are always well informed regarding the project's development and initiatives.\r\n\r\nAnd that brings us to the end of this exploration.

      "body": "_**Welcome back, MSQ fam! You know what time it is—yup, it’s another awesome Discovery of the Day! MSQ recently moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can sign up for a profile and explore all the site has to offer. From Monday to Friday we bring you some of the best projects from across the cryptosphere. Whether it’s NFTs, the Metaverse, or Blockchain games, you’ll find it all right here on MSQ! Today we're taking a closer look at an NFT project called...CryptoonGoonz!**_\r\n\r\n## Looking Back With Fondness\r\n\r\nFor many of us, the lives of those who came before us and the numerous events that transpired are a source of perpetual fascination. We often wonder what life was like 'back then' and try to discern how culture has shifted over the years, comparing what was valued and upheld then with what we hold dear now. Regardless of your perception or understanding of the past, the world today is vastly different from the world back then. There seems to be something about the vintage that evokes a sense of nostalgia within us, and for those of us who are particularly sentimental, we tend to view the art, cartoons and music of yesteryear through a favorable lens.\r\n\r\nIn many regards, the rise of NFTs within the cryptosphere has led to what has been dubbed a 'Digital Renaissance,' and so artists and creators are exploring all kinds of avenues that traverse time and space in weird and wonderful ways. Vintage projects seems to be a subset or genre within the world of NFTs, and here on MSQ, we've already taken a look at projects like [Flowtys,](https://www.flowtys.com/) [Blood Pact](https://www.bloodpact.io/) and [Tony Babel.](https://twitter.com/TonyBabel) Each of these is an attempt to capture or relive the cartoon and animation style of the 1920s and 30s, and each approaches this goal in its own novel way.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bE4gWXr.gif)\r\n\r\n> Vintage animation was highly experimental at times, and given the limited color palette and technology available during that period, was characteristically odd, musically driven and even somewhat unsettling, verging into the realms of the uncanny more often than not. There was no real regard for what was 'safe' or 'correct,' and while many may find the content of some such animations questionable, it is still a very important part of our history that deserves attention and recognition\r\n\r\nToday's Discovery of the Day falls comfortably under the banner of the Vintage and does so with gusto. I for one find these kinds of projects to be particularly interesting, and hopefully, you do as well.\r\n\r\n## Toonz 'n Goonz\r\n\r\n[CryptoonGoonz](https://www.cryptoongoonz.com) is a sold-out collection of 6,969 ERC-721 vintage cartoon-inspired NFTs registered on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) Blockchain and stored via [IPFS](https://ipfs.io). Very nice! There's even a [Goonz Shop](https://cryptoongoonz.shop) where you can score sick merch like shirts, stickers, and more...\r\n\r\nMuch like the bestest of the best projects do, CryptoonGoonz uses multi-signature security via their [Gnosis Safe Wallet](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xD4E4f0A85F8d8f7C0bA36Ef676812790eeD67603), so you can rest assured that your Goonz are safe from evil ne'er-do-wells. And if that's not enough, holding a CryptoonGoonz NFT means you also have DAO voting _**and**_ [ownership rights](https://www.cryptoongoonz.com/terms) over your precious PFPs. Yes, you read that right...actual ownership, meaning you actually have full control over the asset. This is definitely important and the hallmark of a project that takes the role of NFTs very seriously.\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center;\">\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TOtSAnY.gif)\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center;\">\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2mWPO6qQkPIgqgEqQoZ4lK?si=e512643c63ce4477\" width=\"350\" height=\"400\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" style=\"border: none;\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center;\">\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n    \r\n**Rock out with your Toonz out via the CryptoonGoonz [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2mWPO6qQkPIgqgEqQoZ4lK?si=e512643c63ce4477) playlist!**\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nSo what goes in to making each CryptoonGoonz NFT so unique and special? Well, a couple of different traits actually. Each one of these Goonz comes with its own Head, Eyes, Mouth, Body, Accessory, Shorts, Hands and Shoes. Take a look at the example below—observe the flaming marshmallow head, the spooky skeleton body and uh...broken beer bottle being held with intent. I think you get the idea.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/y7C9vkd.png)\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center;\">\r\n\r\n**Listen, if your head was on fire, you wouldn't be this calm...**\r\n    \r\n</div>\r\n\r\nCryptoonGoonz are indeed walking to the right with purpose. Some of them are more polite and easy-going while others carry swords or a less than appropriate attitude. The point here is that the time and energy put into the art is admirable, and you can be pretty confident that the Goon (or Goonz) you get will be one of a kind, practically irreplaceable and, therefore, provably rare. Score!\r\n\r\n## You've Reached the End of Part 1!\r\n\r\nUh yeah, I know this is a weird one, but as it turns out, CryptoonGoonz literally *just* completed their first Roadmap and are in the process of putting together their plans for the next leg of their journey.\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 80%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center;\">\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GJq5g31.jpg)\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nCryptoonGoonz has already achieved a lot, and judging by the size of its following, it's set to be here for the foreseeable future. With such strong fundamentals and attention to detail, it's virtually impossible to ignore CryptoonGoonz. Oh, and they're real good frens with [Alien Frens,](https://alienfrens.io/) in case you didn't know...\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n![](twitter:Cryptoon_Goonz/status/1480659391573549057)\r\n    \r\n</div>\r\n\r\n> Check out this MSQ Discovery of the Day by [Reece Smith](https://MSQ.io/users/reece): [Alien Frens - NFT Pals from Another World](https://MSQ.io/blog/alien-frens-nft-pals-from-another-world)\r\n\r\n## The Minds Behind the Madness\r\n\r\nBeing best friends since they were eight years old, Joel and Sean are able to understand each other and work together effortlessly to achieve their goals. Shortly after coming up with the idea for the project, CryptoonGoonz quickly became a passion project with a lot of work involved. However, seeing everything come together into something they could both be proud of is nothing short of magnificent in my opinion.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ezWzN2p.png)\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center;\">\r\n\r\n**[Joel](https://twitter.com/joel_cryptoon) and [Sean](https://twitter.com/SeanTat2s) are the brains of this operation**\r\n    \r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/0UkdrsGldsyvzffsjLdNSO?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: inherit; margin: auto; text-align: center;\">\r\n  \r\n<br>\r\n    \r\n**Check out the GaryVee Podcast interview of CryptoonGoonz creator Sean on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2mWPO6qQkPIgqgEqQoZ4lK?si=e512643c63ce4477)**\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n## Slapstick Stats\r\n\r\nAll 6,969 CryptoonGoonz have been minted, but you can still find them on the secondary market via [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptoongoonz).

From Monday to Friday we bring you our Discovery of the Day series of articles in which we showcase some of our top picks from across the cryptosphere. Whether it's NFTs, Blockchain gaming or the metaverse, you'll be able to find it all right here on MSQ! Today we take a look at a project by someone famous for being the Godfather of Metal...yup, it's the one and only Ozzy Osbourne with his NFT project, CryptoBatz!***\r\n\r\n## The Prince of Darkness\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UFfgszi.gif)\r\n\r\nNo no, not *that* Prince of Darkness. I mean [Ozzy Osbourne,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzy_Osbourne) the frontman and vocalist of legendary Metal band [Black Sabbath.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath) I owe a whole lot to these pioneers of the slow, chugging, doom-infused brand of music that has since exploded in popularity and splintered into every conceivable sub-genre under the sun—Death Metal, Black Metal, Thrash, Grindcore, Power Metal, Doom...the list of artists and musicians Black Sabbath is basically responsible for bringing into being is virtually endless.\r\n\r\nJohn Michael 'Ozzy' Osbourne was born on December 3rd, 1948 to Lillian and Jack Osbourne. 21 years later, along with [Tony Iommi,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Iommi) [Geezer Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geezer_Butler) and [Bill Ward,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Ward_(musician)) Ozzy would form Black Sabbath, widely regarded as the world's first-ever Metal band. Their debut album *[Black Sabbath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackSabbath(album))* released on February 13th 1970, and in 2019, it was estimated that the band had sold a total of 70 million albums from across their discography over the five decades of their existence.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RAGtIT6.jpg)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n***Black Sabbath* by Black Sabbath (1970) was recorded in a single day on October 16th, 1969**\r\n    \r\n</div>\r\n\r\nNow I could obviously go on about Ozzy and his legacy for hours and hours, but that's not the point of this article. Believe it or not, The Prince of Darkness, now (somehow?) 73, is into crypto and Blockchain technology! Say what!? That might just be the coolest thing I've ever heard! Ozzy isn't the only metalhead into NFTs though...in fact, my good pal [Simon Downey](https://MSQ.io/users/simon) told me about [Megadeth](https://megadeth.com/) and their NFTs, which you can view right [here.](https://megadeth.io/) Seems like a lot of top Metal bands and artists are embracing NFTs, and in today's Discovery of the Day, you'll see that Ozzy himself is more than into it—he's heading up his own NFT project!\r\n\r\n## Straight off the NFT Bat!\r\n\r\nWhether you're aware of the story or not, on January 20th, 1982, Ozzy Osbourne was busy performing at a concert in Des Moines, Iowa. One of the audience members decided to sneak a dead bat into the concert and threw it on stage in front of Ozzy. Mistaking the bat for a toy, Ozzy picked up the deceased creature and promptly...bit off its head.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FfqC4qo.gif)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**Ozzy reprised his role as bat biter in Adam Sandler's *[Little Nicky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LittleNicky)* (2000)**\r\n    \r\n</div>\r\n\r\nAlmost 30 years since the original bat head chomping, Ozzy has launched [CryptoBatz,](https://www.cryptobatz.com/) a collection of 9,666 (that number is no mistake) NFT Bats that dwell in the caves of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. Yes, this delightfully diabolical collection is built by 'a team of NFT obsessed nerds known as [Sutter Systems.'](https://twitter.com/SutterSystems) Seems like the team behind CryptoBatz is a formidable one that is also pushing to innovate and bring new utility to NFT fans through this project that's being overseen by Ozzy Osbourne himself!\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sq7mxNd.gif)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**I see an Ozzy Bat, a Vampire Bat, a Skeletor Bat...blink and you'll miss 'em!**\r\n    \r\n</div>\r\n\r\n## Vampiric NFTs?\r\n\r\nHold on a cotton pickin' minute...just what's going on with this project? So like Herbert West from *[Re-Animator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-Animator)* (1985), the members of Sutter Systems are a little more on the, shall we say, 'mad' side? So in an effort to create an NFT project that truly stands out from other collections, the team spent a great deal of time and energy developing something that would effectively imbue each and every CryptoBat with a truly unique power. What is this power, you ask? Well, CryptoBatz will be able to uh...'bite' an NFT from another Blue Chip project, thus leading to the creation of a 'MutantBat' that possesses the digital DNA of both tokens!\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kD8frNx.png)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**Hmmm, now where have I seen this MutantBat before?**\r\n    \r\n</div>\r\n\r\nNow there is a catch here, so pay close attention. A CryptoBat can only bite **once**, so before letting your CryptoBat bite an NFT, think very carefully about what you choose, because this will ultimately determine what kind of MutantBat will be created. In addition, if you want your CryptoBat to bite a 'Victim,' you will need to hold that Blue Chip NFT in the same wallet as your CryptoBat. Biting utility isn't active yet but will be enabled soon after the public mint takes place (date TBD). At present, the list of Blue Chip 'Victim Projects' your CryptoBat can bite includes:\r\n\r\n- [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/)\r\n- [CrypToadz](https://cryptoadz.io/)\r\n- [SupDucks](https://supducks.com/)\r\n- [Alien Frens](https://alienfrens.io/)\r\n\r\n## Doing the Maths on the Batz\r\n\r\nYes, there is indeed more to CryptoBatz than meets the eyes. In terms of the composition and design of the CryptoBatz, the Fibonacci Sequence (or [Golden Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio)) has been employed to ensure that the Batz, while dark, spooky and outrageous, are pleasing to look at. Also, all the traits that make up the CryptoBatz were selected by Ozzy, so every single minted CryptoBat will be truly special since they're the product of Ozzy's creative choices. That's seriously awesome!\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6P0De84.png)\r\n\r\n## AncientBatz\r\n\r\nSo those individuals who hold a CryptoBat will be eligible to participate in an epic treasure hunt! Right, so remember how I mentioned that CryptoBatz can only bite once? Well, if you're lucky enough to find one, AncientBatz are capable of biting up to *ninety-nine* (99) times, giving them the unmatched ability to breed a whopping 99 MutantBatz! Wowzers!\r\n\r\nEvery one of the AncientBatz has been custom designed by some of the most renowned and talented artists in the world, so anyone who manages to get their hands on one not only has a unique NFT with a huge amount of utility, but a piece of digital art that is virtually one of a kind. Finding such rare and powerful Batz won't be easy though since the team has scattered the AncientBatz across the face of the planet. Who knows? An AncientBatz NFT may be in a river, high up a mountain or hiding in the recesses of a sewer. In others words, these special Batz really aren't easy to find—at all.\r\n\r\nEvery week clues and hints will be provided to the most engaged and active members of the CryptoBatz community, gradually revealing the locations of AncientBatz, thus making them easier to find as time goes by. If someone is lucky enough to find an AncientBat, they will simply scan a QR Code that reveals a special wallet that can only be unlocked using that person's CryptoBat. In time, an interactive world map will be released, so stay tuned for more details!\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NOtkiRM.png)\r\n\r\n## Hard Road(map)\r\n\r\nThe CryptoBatz Roadmap is divided into 5 different phases or chapters. Take a look at our reworked design of the current Roadmap:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mAJoupD.png)\r\n\r\n> If you want to see the Roadmap in its original form, click [here](https://www.cryptobatz.com/#roadmap)\r\n\r\n## The Team\r\n\r\nBesides The Godfather of Metal himself, Sutter Systems is made up of six core members (according to the CryptoBatz website at least):\r\n\r\n- **[Jepeggi](https://twitter.com/Jepeggi)** - Co-founder\r\n- **[Gelbstein](https://twitter.com/JAgelbstein)** - Co-founder\r\n- **Eleven** - Lead Dev\r\n- **Resistant Material** - Art Direction\r\n- **[Danny](https://twitter.com/DannyPhantomNFT)** - Community Manager\r\n- **[Ash](https://twitter.com/ashrobinqt)** - Community Manager\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vyq15W5.png)\r\n\r\n## All Aboard the Crazy Train!\r\n\r\nOK, so the question is 'Wen CryptoBatz?' Well, if you want to find out more about the Mint Date, you'll have to join the CryptoBatz [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ah54FS98HE) and get all the info you need there.

      "body": "***Hey there everyone! Welcome to another incredible Discovery of the Day! MSQ recently moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can now sign up for a profile and explore all the site has to offer. From Monday to Friday we bring you some of the best projects from across the cryptosphere. Whether it's NFTs, the metaverse or Blockchain games, you'll find it all right here on MSQ! Today we take a look at an NFT project building a brand for the metaverse. This is...Azuki!***\r\n\r\n## A World of Brands\r\n\r\nWe live in a world populated with hundreds of thousands of brands—soft drink companies, clothing labels, sports shoes, cans of beans, and just about everything out there in the physical world is emblazoned with some kind of emblem or insignia. Some brands are so ubiquitous and all-encompassing that they are more or less a fixture in the lives of millions or even billions of human beings all over the world.\r\n\r\nThe most successful brands are powerful and go to great lengths to ensure that they remain relevant in the rapidly evolving postmodern world. It's no surprise then that many well-known brands are dipping their toes into the waters of NFTs and the metaverse. [Coca-Cola,](https://www.coca-cola.com/) [Adidas](https://www.adidas.com/) and [Burger King](https://www.bk.com/) are just a few of the major companies that have or are currently getting into NFTs and the metaverse, and you can be sure that many more will follow as the impetus for companies to expand their offerings and cater to individuals and groups in virtual environments increases.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NY3T35m.png)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n    \r\n**Coca-Cola's first set of NFTs were auctioned for well over $500,000**\r\n    \r\n</div>\r\n\r\nNow if existing brands are getting into NFTs and the metaverse, maybe it's time for the metaverse to develop its own definitive brand or set of brands. The difference here is that communities can participate in developing and supporting brands and even earn rewards for doing so. Sounds like a pretty cool idea, doesn't it? Well then, you're gonna want to check this out...\r\n\r\n## Building a Brand Together\r\n\r\n[Azuki](https://www.azuki.com/) is a brand for the metaverse built by, well, the community. It's a collection of 10,000 avatars that will give you membership and access to [The Garden,](https://www.azuki.com/garden) a special corner of the internet where art, community, and culture come together to make magic happen. In case you haven't noticed, the lines between the physical and digital worlds are blurring, and the rules are being rewritten as we speak.\r\n\r\nAzuki's vision entails the creation of the largest decentralized brand for the metaverse that is built and owned by the community itself. In order to integrate into the metaverse, the project is exploring the prospect of taking their 2D avatars and converting them into 3D models that will allow holders to enjoy an immersive metaverse experience like no other. On top of all this, if you're on Team Azuki, you'll be dripped out on the metaverse with some sweet digital apparel and accessories 😎\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tFDaHYc.jpg)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**'We are the skaters of the internet'**\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nAzuki's first priority is their community. As such, they plan to mobilize the various members of their community in a scalable and meaningful way. In order to do so, the team plans to hire global ambassadors to run meetups for the community all over the world! Azuki wants to help empower artists as well as educate the community on Web3 and how to stay safe when navigating the many features associated with this emerging iteration of the internet. Furthermore, Azuki has some exciting plans for not just the digital world, but the physical world as well. Members of *The Garden* will get access to exclusive drops of streetwear, IRL events, collectibles and much more!\r\n\r\n## The Dream Team\r\n\r\nAzuki is made up of several talented individuals with backgrounds in crypto, technology and gaming. In fact, one of the team's artists is the illustrious [steamboy,](https://twitter.com/steamboy33) the Character Art Director of the popular team-based FPS shooter [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-gb/). However, the true team behind Azuki is the broader community itself—Azuki is a global initiative of many individuals working together to achieve something truly profound and distinct from other endeavors. The core team consists of:\r\n\r\n- **[ZZZAGABOND.ETH](https://twitter.com/ZZZAGABOND)** - Human Bean\r\n- **[steamboy](https://twitter.com/steamboy33)** - Artist\r\n- **[2pm.flow](https://twitter.com/2pmflow)** - Engineer\r\n- **[location tba](https://twitter.com/locationtba)** - Engineer\r\n- **[Hoshi Boy](https://twitter.com/hoshiboyzen)** - Design\r\n- **[Andrew Hou (Joo)](https://twitter.com/njoo)** - Artist\r\n- **[Genghis Kwan](https://twitter.com/GenghisKwan)** - Artist\r\n- **[daph.eth](https://twitter.com/daphtheSHAFT)** - Community\r\n- **[Beanboop](https://twitter.com/BeboopAzuki)** - Community\r\n- **[pizookie](https://twitter.com/pizookie1)** - Community\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RCAC2vZ.png)\r\n\r\nApart from Azuki's dedication to their community, one of my favorite parts of this project is its definitive art style. I mean, just look at it—it's bloody fantastic, isn't it!? Take a look at these specimens:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dcYQs8a.jpg)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**Turning up the heat in the NFT space!**\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FyV44Oc.jpg)\r\n    \r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**'Buy the ticket, take the ride'**\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KkL14db.jpg)\r\n    \r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**If you play with fire, you must get burnt...**\r\n    \r\n</div>\r\n\r\n## A Cerebral Mindmap\r\n\r\nWe've covered a fair amount of ground already, but let's dive into some of the exciting things Azuki has in store for those who decide to contribute! Within its extensive seven part Mindmap, Azuki has items listed including streetwear, partnerships, a DAO, the launch of the $BEAN token, digital drip, developing their metaverse and so on and so forth. Take a look at the full Mindmap below 👇\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eZCbp5c.png)\r\n\r\n> If you want to find out more about each component within the Mindmap, click [here](https://www.azuki.com/mindmap) and get exploring!\r\n\r\n## Totally Sick Stats\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the Azuki collection is sold out, but you can still pick up one or more of these fantastic avatars over on the project's [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/azuki) page. And now for a cursory look at a couple of pertinent stats:\r\n\r\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\r\n\r\n* **Total Items** - 9.9K\r\n* **Owners** - 4.7K\r\n\r\nWith its polished comic book-style art and community oriented outlook, Azuki is an NFT and metaverse project that you should definitely take seriously. Be sure to follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AzukiZen) and join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/azuki) so that you receive all the info you need about the project as and when it is released.\r\n\r\nAnd thus we reach the end of yet another unforgettable journey.

MSQ recently moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can now sign up for a profile and explore all the site has to offer, so be sure to get your profile and join our growing community. In today's edition we take a closer look at an NFT land trading strategy game built on Ethereum...Welcome to Metroverse!***\r\n\r\n## SimCity Gone Blockchain?\r\n\r\nWhen I was a kid I played many different kinds of games—real-time strategy, first-person shooters, role-playing games, you name it, I was into it...or at the very least, I had experience in each genre. I distinctly remember certain simulator games that I particularly enjoyed including [Jane's Longbow Gold,](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Jane%27s_Longbow_Gold) [Simcopter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCopter) and [SimCity 2000.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_2000) If you had to gauge my interests based on these three games alone, it would be flying helicopters and running cities (which I assure you isn't the case).\r\n\r\nAnyway, in SimCity 2000, you get the opportunity to build up your own metropolis and ensure that its inhabitants are provided with all the necessary facilities and infrastructure they require in order to live their lives and meaningfully contribute to society. Now this is much easier said than done—you have to set tax rates, build roads and highways, provide residents with electricity, construct schools and hospitals, and take great care ensuring that garbage and sewage are adequately dealt with. In many ways, these duties are just the tip of the iceberg as there are a host of other considerations you need to make. In addition, natural disasters and, um...alien invasions (I'm serious) could really put a damper on your plans.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xNyEcvn.png)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**There you are, just minding your own business, and then BOOM! Aliens!**\r\n    \r\n</div>\r\n\r\nAliens and tornadoes aside, SimCity 2000 was not an easy game, and at the age of 8 or 9, I found myself impeached on more than one occasion (the nerve of my constituents, really!) Having said this, I was able to build some pretty awesome cities, one of which was along a coastline that I created as an homage to my hometown of [Durban, South Africa.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durban) After several years serving as the expansive urban megalith's mayor, I was booted for reasons I can't recall (something about mismanagement of funds or something, you know the drill).\r\n\r\nNeedless to say I've been a SimCity fan since, so having stumbled across today's Discovery of the Day, you can bet that my interest was piqued. The prospect of a Blockchain version of SimCity, or even just something akin to it, is very intriguing indeed. So, without further ado, let's get into it!\r\n\r\n## Your Very Own City Block(chain)\r\n\r\n[Metroverse](https://metroverse.com/) is an NFT-based land trading strategy game constructed on the foundations of the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. There are a total of 10,000 city blocks in the Metroverse with each one being characteristically unique. A single block, represented by an ERC-721 NFT, may contain residential, industrial, commercial and/or public buildings. Since each block is an NFT, there will only ever be one of each minted, and given their distinct features and intricate layouts, they are virtually impossible to replicate.\r\n\r\nPlayers must use a strategic approach to collect and trade city blocks so that they can grow their economies and earn $MET, Metroverse's in-game currency. The main idea is to collect multiple city blocks and build up neighborhoods since every block yields MET tokens, and so with more blocks in action, more MET can be generated. $MET can be used within the game's economy to improve players' holdings and generate even more MET in the process.\r\n\r\n### Zones\r\n\r\nSo let's see one of these city blocks up close and discuss some of its features in a little more detail:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/J8Bppb7.jpg)\r\n\r\n> City blocks contain a beautifully colorful visual representation of the NFT itself as well as a few key metrics. In the bottom left-hand corner you'll spot three colored letters and bars along with numbers to the right of each. **R** stands for residential, **C** for commercial and **I** for industry. You'll notice here that **R** and **C** have scores of 121 and 125 respectively while **I** only has a score of 90. In the bottom right-hand corner you'll see the number 336, the total score that this NFT has when the three adjacent figures are added up. The total score of a given block is always between 200 and 400—no more, no less\r\n\r\n### Pathways\r\n\r\nPathways describe the different kinds of infrastructure that allow for transportation to occur within each city block. As such, Pathways may consist of:\r\n\r\n- Streets\r\n- Railways, and\r\n- Rivers\r\n\r\nEvery single city block will feature one horizontal and one vertical pathway that appears in a random location within a block. Since there are always two pathways, 15 tiles are always dedicated to them while the remaining 49 are for buildings.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0yV20Zs.jpg)\r\n\r\n## City Councilors\r\n\r\nThe team behind Metroverse is pretty extensive and includes developers, designers, artists and community management specialists with several years of experience in their respective fields.\r\n\r\n### Development\r\n\r\n- [0xSlice](https://twitter.com/0xSlice) - Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur\r\n- [0xSlime](https://twitter.com/0xSlime) - Web3 based crypto-native\r\n- [0xAyam](https://twitter.com/0xAyam) - Dev and crypto native\r\n- [0xBobsky](https://twitter.com/0xbobsky) - Coding since the age of 14\r\n\r\n### Design\r\n\r\n- [0xHedgehog](https://twitter.com/0xHedgehog) - The genius behind Metroverse's design\r\n- [0xRam](https://twitter.com/0xRam) - 3D designer specializing in stylized art and Blender\r\n\r\n### Community\r\n\r\n- Mrs Slime - Over a decade of management experience\r\n- [0xDrill](https://twitter.com/0xdrill) - Metroverse-based intersex citizen with 9 years of experience in tech\r\n- [0xJugga](https://twitter.com/0xjugga) - 18-year-old NFT enthusiast\r\n- [0xAdo](https://twitter.com/0xado) - 18-year-old tech fanatic\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/knyUvHn.png)\r\n\r\n## Urban Roadmap\r\n\r\nMetroverse is right at the beginning of its journey, so pretty much everything on their Roadmap is about to happen or due to be fulfilled in the near future. Once the $MET token has launched, Mayors will be available for mint. Later, Metroverse plans to release a Player versus Player (PvP) game, but only once Mayors have been introduced into the mix. See for yourself:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vaSyE4U.png)\r\n\r\n> If you want to check out the Metroverse Roadmap in its original form, click [here](https://metroverse.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Future of Metroverse\r\n\r\nThere's a lot going on with Metroverse, but in short, the Whitelist Sale takes place on Tuesday, January 18th while the Public Sale will be held one day later on Wednesday, January 19th. FYI, according to their website, each city block will cost 0.1 ETH (excluding gas) to mint.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MzEVRoK.png)\r\n\r\nSo is Metroverse popular? Judging by their substantially large social media following, I would confidently answer 'yes.' Just take a look at this Twitter post regarding their upcoming mint on Tuesday:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n![](twitter:themetroverse/status/1482423376434110464)\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nSo yeah, Metroverse seems to have garnered a whole lot of interest and support, and based on their active Twitter and awesome looking NFTs, it seems like this support will continue to grow for the foreseeable future. For this reason I strongly recommend you follow Metroverse on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/themetroverse) and join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/metroverse) so that you receive all the latest news as and when it's released.\r\n\r\n> For more information about Metroverse, check out their FAQ section on their [official website](https://metroverse.com/) and/or read their [Documentation](https://docs.metroverse.com/introduction/summary)\r\n\r\nThanks for joining me today.

      "body": "***Hello one and all! Welcome to another awesome Discovery of the Day! MSQ recently moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can now sign up for a profile and explore all the site has to offer. From Monday to Friday we bring you some of the best projects from across the cryptosphere. Whether it's NFTs, the metaverse or Blockchain games, you'll find it all right here on MSQ! Today we take a look at an NFT project that portrays powerful, expressive women and non-binary people from all walks of life...This is Non-Fungible People!***\r\n\r\n## We Are Not the Same (And That's OK)\r\n\r\nWouldn't life be fantastic if we all looked, sounded and acted the same? Well, that reality might be a more peaceful one, but from my perspective, it sounds a little...boring. While we are all equal in terms of our human rights and responsibilities, to say we are all the same, or at the very least 'identical,' is a bit of a stretch. There are people of all different shapes and sizes, skin tones, attitudes, religious beliefs, body types and genders...the list is pretty extensive. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with any of this—diversity is one of the things that makes being human such a profoundly unique experience.\r\n\r\nIn the postmodern world, the issue of identity is one that is becoming increasingly important as more and more people are born and 'standing out' becomes exponentially more challenging. Who am I? What does it mean to be human? And what are the things the constitute my own experience and shape my thoughts and perceptions? These and similar questions are present within the minds of countless millions of people, and for good reason as well. It's important that we reflect on these questions and challenge our own beliefs so that we can learn constructive ways to become kinder humans and treat others with the same love and respect that we wish to receive.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/e2MBYpD.gif)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n    \r\n**The late [David Bowie's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie) alter ego, [Ziggy Stardust,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Ziggy_Stardust_and_the_Spiders_from_Mars) challenged conventional notions of identity and sexuality**\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the metaverse, virtual reality and NFTs, the issue of identity is doubtlessly becoming more complex as people focus on creating their own personas around profile pics and avatars that may not even be human. It therefore stands to reason that some NFT projects are pushing the envelope a little more when it comes to exploring issues of identity and further expanding on the extent of our perceptions.\r\n\r\n## Non-Fungible People\r\n\r\n[Non-Fungible People](https://nfp.daz3d.com/) is a collection of expertly rendered 3D avatars that features lifelike women and non-binary people from all walks of life. Each NFT includes a fully rigged 3D model built for utility within and across the metaverse. Non-Fungible People NFTs consist of a variety of different traits including hair, clothing, makeup, expressions, eye color and more. Like every woman and non-binary person IRL, this collection emphasizes how unique and nuanced each and every NFP is.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M5yImqq.jpg)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**Beautiful, quirky and mysterious, Non-Fungible people certainly has its own distinct allure**\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nOne of the best parts of Non-Fungible People is the sheer level of utility you get out of a single NFT. Owning an NFP gives you the ability to create games, render animations and/or produce your own videos. This is because each 3D figure is compatible with popular programs such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/), [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [Daz Studio](https://www.daz3d.com/). With regards to the latter, since NFP NFTs are Daz Studio models, you can add or remove assets and position them as desired in order to create your own 3D works of art. The real beauty of Non-Fungible People is that, when you hold an NFP, you own it in its entirety and can do anything you'd like with it.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lONljZd.png)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**Learn more about Non-Fungible People and their utility [here](https://nfp.daz3d.com/#utility)**\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nI'm sure you're curious to take a closer look at these NFTs, so let's get straight to it:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nbU5O2y.jpg)\r\n\r\n> NFPs may possess both masculine and feminine features, or they may be more feminine in appearance. Regardless, each 3D character has its own unique personality and encourages us to think carefully about how we perceive others and how we view ourselves as human beings\r\n\r\n### Partnerships\r\n\r\nThe team kicked off the New Year collection by announcing two impressive partnerships with [Champion](https://www.championstore.com/en_es/) and [Louis Moinet.](https://www.louismoinet.com/) In their own words, Non-Fungible People aims to 'bring next level mutations and upgrades to the NFP collection.' Be sure to follow Non-Fungible People on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NFungiblePeople) so that you can keep up to speed with all the latest info regarding these partnerships.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0XIJytI.png)\r\n\r\n## Pathfinders in a Digital World\r\n\r\nThe Non-Fungible People recently wrapped up their mint sale and are currently progressing through the various items in their Roadmap. The team has a bunch of fun things planned including giveaways, merchandise, events hosted in the metaverse, monthly tutorials and workshops that teach holders how to get the most out of their NFPs, and, finally, Non-Fungible People Generation 2 which is slated for release later this year.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of the items and events that Non-Fungible People will be working to fulfill throughout 2022:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RM9N8GU.png)\r\n\r\n> If you'd like to view the original Roadmap in full detail, visit Non-Fungible People's [official website](https://nfp.daz3d.com/#roadmap)\r\n\r\n## Eccentric Stats\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the NFP collection is sold out, but you can still pick up one or more of these fantastic avatars over on the project's [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/non-fungible-people-daz3d) page. And now for a quick look at a couple of key stats:\r\n\r\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\r\n\r\n* **Total Items** - 8,888\r\n* **Owners** - 3.6K\r\n\r\nWith its expressive 3D models and vast utility, Non-Fungible People is an NFT and metaverse project you'll want to keep a close eye on.

From Monday to Friday, we bring you some of the best projects from across the cryptosphere. Whether it’s NFTs, the Metaverse, or Blockchain games, you’ll find it all right here on MSQ! Today we're taking a closer look at...Propel!**_\r\n\r\n## To Innovate Is Human\r\n\r\nThe use of tools predates the emergence of our earliest ancestors and is considered to have been essential to our evolution. What appears to be earlier iterations of the stone hand axe have been found to have existed as far back as several million years ago. *Australopithecus Afarensis* is believed to have carved animal carcasses; their hands were well suited for the controlled manipulation of objects. Even today, our primate cousins are often observed using tools to dig, probe soil and trees for insects, groom themselves, defend against attackers, and even communicate with one another.\r\n\r\nAnd while these primitive examples bear little resemblance to the tools of today, this serves as a reminder of how critical and transformative the mastery of tools has been to humankind. Tools aren't only a reflection of our technological innovations over the millennia; they are the very things that have driven our evolution from the stone age all the way through to the modern era.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NF4kiBy.jpg)\r\n\r\n<div align =\"center\">\r\n\r\n**Lower Palaeolithic Acheulean Handaxe**<br>**(dated approx. 500,000 - 300,000 years ago)**<br>\r\nsource: [Wikimedia Commons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Biface_Cintegabelle_MHNT_PRE_2009.0.201.1_V2.jpg/1024px-Biface_Cintegabelle_MHNT_PRE_2009.0.201.1_V2.jpg)\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n## Propelling Ourselves Forward\r\n\r\nWe inherently cannot know what the next step in our evolution will be, but the emergence of the Digital Age has shown us that our social and financial infrastructures are due for innovation. The world has changed, and new tools are needed. Today, we take a closer look at [Propel](https://propel.xyz), a plug-n-play development toolkit enabling the rapid deployment of a variety of digital infrastructures and services, including:\r\n\r\n- **Metaverse as a Service (MaaS)**\r\n- **DeFi as a Service (DaaS)**, and\r\n- **Staking as a Service (SaaS)**\r\n\r\nAll the more impressive is that this toolkit is chain-agnostic, meaning it can be used across dozens of networks, including [Bitcoin,](https://bitcoin.org/) [Ethereum,](https://ethereum.org/) and [Solana.](https://solana.com/) Propel's source code is also fully [audited,](https://github.com/PropelXYZ/audits) something any serious project should never go without.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OrQAz2p.jpg)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**View the Propel Whitepaper [here](https://propel.xyz/static/media/PropelWhitepaper.7d4d055e.pdf)**\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n## Metaverse as a Service (MaaS)\r\n\r\nA metaverse wide detonation is on the way. Hence, Propel introduced Metaverse as a Service (MaaS) to enable projects to get started quickly and free developers from having to start from scratch. The Blockchain plugins required to establish a metaverse environment are included in MaaS.\r\n\r\n**Smart Verse Contracts** fuel automated verification, negotiation, resolution, and performance. The metaverse is based on smart contracts interconnected with each other through the logic of creation and the functionality they are used for where users are able to own and control their digital identities.\r\n\r\n**GameFi** uses Propel's $PEL token for player transactions; investors may also buy NFTs in-game and resell them on the secondary market as their value rises. This also allows for the creation and disbursement of raffle tickets and NFT Battle fusing, where users can burn multiple NFTs to mint new ones.\r\n\r\n**NFT Utilities** enable renting NFTs (re-NFT) where lenders can earn passive income; fractional NFTs (f-NFT), which are essentially fractionalized versions of a traditional NFT; as well as staking NFTs (s-NFT).\r\n\r\nIn combination, these serve as the **Core Metaverse** toolkit; Propel's complete, configurable, and secure solution for integrating the ERC standards into a project, saving precious development time.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HGTXBRA.gif)\r\n\r\n## DeFi as a Service (DaaS)\r\n\r\nA plug-n-play DeFi solution for new and existing projects to spin up custom DeFi smart contracts such as cross-chain bridges, LP Staking, Token creation, Multisig wallets, Vesting contracts, and Investor dashboards.\r\n\r\n**Cross-chain Bridges** are a white-labeled DeFi solution that helps projects set up bridges across multiple supported ecosystems, including Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, and other Layer2 chains.\r\n\r\n**Custom Solutions** - Each project is unique; therefore, Propel develops customized solutions to meet clients' needs and help them achieve maximum ROI and exposure.\r\n\r\nThe **Investor Dashboard** module is a customizable interface for Blockchain projects to design token sale campaigns and manage tokenomics as per their configured vesting schedule.\r\n\r\n**Staking / LP Staking** is a module supporting single-asset staking and LP staking from multiple popular AMMs like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) and [PancakeSwap.](https://pancakeswap.finance/)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7v4q4Hy.png)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**Visit the Propel App [here](https://app.propel.xyz)**\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n## Staking as a Service (SaaS)\r\n\r\nThe Propel pool provides a way to reward users for staking single assets, LP tokens, and traditional tokens. Through Propel pool, users can earn passive income and allow projects to increase the demand for their tokens.\r\n\r\n**Single Asset Staking** where users can deposit a token and are rewarded proportionally according to the magnitude of their staked amount.\r\n\r\n**LP Staking** allows users to deposit LP tokens (token pairs) and are rewarded with tokens proportional to the size of their staked amount.\r\n\r\n**Time Capped Staking** offers whale protection; a user will be allowed maximum tokens capping for a certain period of time to have fair participation.\r\n\r\n**Basket Rewards** where users deposit a given token and are rewarded with multiple different tokens proportionate to the size of their staked amount.\r\n\r\n## $PEL Token\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PfNwGNt.png)\r\n\r\n$PEL is Propel's native governance token. Staking, reward sharing through providing liquidity to or safeguarding the protocol, as well as governance procedures, will all use $PEL as the fundamental utility token across a portfolio of Propel products.\r\n\r\n$PEL, which may be utilized to engage in platform governance, is earned by actual participation in protocol operations and maintenance. This technique enables ecosystem alignment by creating a fair incentivization model and allowing for community-driven governance. $PEL contains features such as:\r\n\r\n- **Staking** - Users can stake $PEL to earn rewards and participate in Launchpools;\r\n- **Governance** - Where users can signal their intention to make platform decisions via $PEL native token governance, and\r\n- **Deflation via Platform Growth** - As Propel  grows, $PEL is retained and acquired for B2B deals\r\n\r\nAdditional $PEL Token Metrics:\r\n\r\n- **Max Supply** - 100,000,000\r\n- **Binance Smart Chain Token Contract (BEP-20)** - [0xa75e7928d3de682e3f44da60c26f33117c4e6c5c](https://bscscan.com/token/0xa75e7928d3de682e3f44da60c26f33117c4e6c5c)\r\n\r\n## So _Does_ This Matter?\r\n\r\nSome see things like Crypto, NFTs, and the Metaverse as passing fads, but the same was said for the internet, the radio, and even the printing press itself. And while [Gutenberg](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg) could never have foreseen Blogs and Blockchains, his invention undeniably shaped the future of communications and commerce. What's beyond the horizon is often hard to imagine, but the tools of today drive the innovations of tomorrow.\r\n\r\nSo **_does_ a Metaverse toolbox _really_ matter?** I'd argue that it does. If there's anything our world needs, it's a new way forward. And what better way than by making our digital infrastructures more tangible and accessible to all?\r\n\r\nBe sure to follow Propel on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/propelxyz) and visit their blog on [Medium](https://propelxyz.medium.com) to keep up on the latest news and developments. If you're code-savvy, you can also take a deeper dive via the Propel [GitHub](https://github.com/propelxyz).\r\n\r\nThanks again for stopping by, MSQ friends.

From Monday to Friday we bring you our top picks from the world of NFTs, Blockchain gaming and the metaverse in the form of a Discovery of the Day. In today's edition we zoom in on a metaverse project that's quite literally building 'up'...this is Ethereum Towers!***\r\n\r\n## The Sky's the Limit\r\n\r\nOver the years, human beings have managed to build some of the most incredible structures imaginable—the pyramids of Giza, the Colosseum, Stonehenge, and the Taj Mahal are just a few of the most extraordinary pieces of architecture that have endured for hundreds or even thousands of years. Soaring cathedrals, massive universities, complex waterways and gigantic monuments can be found in just about every continent on the planet and are testament to the ingenuity and strength of the human spirit.\r\n\r\nIn the last few decades we have dedicated a tremendous amount of time, effort and capital towards the construction of skyscrapers, and as technology has advanced, we have managed to build bigger and higher than before. As of 2020, the world's tallest buildings are:\r\n\r\n- 3rd place - **Shanghai Tower** in China - 632 m (2,073 ft), 128 floors + 5 underground\r\n- 2nd place - **Merdeka 118** in Malaysia - 678 m (2,227 ft), 118 floors + 5 underground\r\n- 1st place - **Burj Khalifa** in the United Arab Emirates - 828 m (2,717 ft), 163 floors + 1 underground\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kxasmEG.jpg)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**At a staggering 828 meters high, Dubai's [Burj Khalifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_Khalifa) is the world's tallest building**\r\n    \r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThe unrelenting ambition of engineering and design to constantly push the boundaries of what is achievable have led to the creation of structures that almost defy logic and physics. Sci-fi movies like *[Blade Runner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BladeRunner)* (1982) depict a future in which cities consist of multiple monolithic skyscrapers and high-rise buildings for as far as the eye can see. According to the [United Nations,](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/population/world-urbanization-prospects-2014.html) in 2014, 54% of the world's population lived in cities, and if their projections are correct, this figure will increase to 66% (almost two-thirds of the world's population) by 2050!\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether the future will feature massive levels of urbanization and the creation of Megacities ala *[Judge Dredd,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JudgeDredd)* the metaverse is a place (or even multiple places) where just about anything can exist. While some projects are looking to build out and spread across a horizontal plane, others are reaching for the stars...so, without further delay, let's get stuck in!\r\n\r\n## Premium Metaverse Real Estate\r\n\r\n[Ethereum Towers](https://ethereumtowers.com/) is what you might consider to be a (or even the first) 'vertical metaverse' project owing to its rather unique approach. Simply put, Ethereum Towers will consist of:\r\n\r\n- 2 hyper-modern spiraling towers\r\n- 202 floors (101 in each tower)\r\n- 4,388 apartments, and\r\n- 1 incredible community\r\n\r\nUpon closer inspection of the project's website, it's clear that a huge amount of time and attention has gone into constructing the two massive skyscrapers that make up Ethereum Towers. This gorgeously rendered jewel of virtual engineering was designed by award-winning architects and is strongly influenced by the design considerations and conventions of the megastructures we see in the world today. According to its creators, Ethereum Towers will be the premiere residence in an ever-expanding metaverse that promises to provide visitors and residents with a dynamic social experience like no other.\r\n\r\n[IBC DAO](https://www.ibcdao.xyz/) recently announced a collaboration with Ethereum Towers—check out this video one of their community members put together to celebrate it:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n![](twitter:IBCDAO/status/1483393467300876295)\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n## The Way It All Works\r\n\r\nEthereum Towers is a community-centered 'vertical metaverse' that exists in two identical 101-story towers. Simply put, players will acquire their own virtual apartments which exist in the form of ERC-721 tokens (or NFTs) on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) Blockchain. By holding an apartment, players will have full access to the Ethereum Towers Metaverse.\r\n\r\nEvery apartment can be customized and designed in any way a player sees fit. They may choose to furnish their apartments according to their own specifications and divide it up however they wish. Players will also be able to access an in-game marketplace that contains a wide variety of furnishings and accessories. Furthermore, the options available will increase and become more diverse as time goes by. Each and every item will be deployed as an NFT, thus providing players with full ownership over anything they acquire via purchase or exchange.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/81OzJ17.png)\r\n\r\nThe main objective is to provide players with an authentic and immersive online experience. Players will be able to interact with one another in their apartments as well as any communal areas located throughout the Towers. By socializing and talking to one another, a real sense of community and togetherness will arise, leaving players with a lasting sense of belonging and wholeness.\r\n\r\nThe Ethereum Towers ecosystem will make use of its very own native in-game currency that will exist as an ERC-20 token. As such, players will be able to use the token to:\r\n\r\n- Mint in-game items\r\n- Trade in-game items\r\n- Participate in events, and\r\n- Much more!\r\n\r\nBy owning an apartment in Ethereum Towers, players will belong to a truly unique collective and have the honor of living in one of the most exclusive and sought after locations in the Ethereum Worlds Metaverse (and likely the metaverse as a whole). There's no way you want to miss out on this one!\r\n\r\n> Learn more about Ethereum Towers in their [Lightpaper](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OT7kCE5fswXvGHLOaLb7Wp8knM6Hz_Si)\r\n\r\n## Virtual Real Estate Developers\r\n\r\nAnd just who is the team behind Ethereum Towers? Well, the core team consists of the following individuals:\r\n\r\n- **Jason** - Founder & Chief Executive Officer\r\n- **Shane** - Chief Operations Officer\r\n- **Brandon** - Chief Product Officer\r\n- **Emma** - Culture & Events Director\r\n\r\nIn addition to the core team, Ethereum Towers recently appointed [Dominic Ryder,](https://twitter.com/dominicvemp) the CEO of [vEmpire,](https://v-empire.io/) to their advisory board. Dominic was largely responsible for vEmpire's ascent in the latter half of 2021 and already holds several advisory positions in other upcoming Blockchain/metaverse ventures. He will be assisting Ethereum Towers with their business model, tokenomics, service provider networks and several other aspects of their development for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n![](twitter:EthereumTowers/status/1478819754685218829?s=20)\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n> You can find out more about the team and their credentials on page 18 of their [Lightpaper](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OT7kCE5fswXvGHLOaLb7Wp8knM6Hz_Si)\r\n\r\n## Building Plans and Blueprints\r\n\r\nThe final quarter of 2021 was a busy time for Ethereum Towers. Much of the team's efforts focused on laying the foundations for the project, community relations, creating architectural assets, metaverse discovery and technology development. Much more is still planned for 2022 and beyond - just take a look at Ethereum Towers' current Roadmap:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R0Cq7fs.png)\r\n\r\n> To view the full Roadmap, please click [here](https://ethereumtowers.com/)\r\n\r\n## Skyscraper Stats\r\n\r\nEthereum Towers' apartments are selling like hotcakes, and if you want one, you'll need to visit their [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/ethereum-towers) page and make an offer there. And now let's take a look at some important stats:\r\n\r\n*Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information.*\r\n\r\n- **Total Items** - 1.8K\r\n- **Owners** - 1K\r\n\r\nEthereum Towers is a serious endeavor with an active team and growing community. On top of this, the project is truly community-centric and has already collaborated with several other reputable projects including [The Doge Pound,](https://thedogepoundnft.com/) [World of Women,](https://worldofwomen.art/) and [The Anatomical Project.](https://theanatomicalproject.com/) By leveraging the power of the community, Ethereum Towers has been able to grow their following and cater to a wider audience in a relatively short space of time.\r\n\r\nThe question is not, 'should I follow Ethereum Towers?'

      "body": "***Hey everyone and welcome to another totally sweet Discovery of the Day! MSQ recently moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can now sign up for a profile and explore all the site has to offer. From Monday to Friday we bring you some of the best projects from across the cryptosphere. Whether it's NFTs, the metaverse or Blockchain games, you'll find it all right here on MSQ! Today we take a closer look at an NFT project doing their part to help save the ocean...Fishy Fam!***\r\n\r\n## Water, Water Everywhere!\r\n\r\nThe surface of the Earth is made up of about 71% water, the vast majority of which is brine which, needless to say, cannot be consumed by humans in order for them to stay hydrated. Having said this, the importance of the planet's oceans cannot be overstated. Somewhere between 50 and 80% of all life is found within the oceans, and since so many communities depend on the bounties of the sea for their survival, it's crucial that these massive underwater ecosystems are carefully looked after so that future generations can continue to benefit from them.\r\n\r\nThere is an estimated 5.25 *trillion* pieces of plastic waste in our oceans, which equates to about 46,000 individual pieces of plastic in every square mile of ocean. This is somewhere in the region of 269,000 tonnes of plastic waste. Every single day, nearly 8 million pieces of plastic makes its way into our oceans. Those are some really depressing facts that I wish weren't true, but even if you've only seen some of the material on YouTube and The Discovery Channel, it's pretty clear our oceans are in dire straits.\r\n\r\nThankfully there are forces working tirelessly to turn the tide on this massive problem and improve the state of our oceans. Every day there are people, groups, and charities working to reduce and put an end to pollution in our oceans once and for all. This is exactly what our Fishy Fam frens intend to help accomplish. So let's take a deep *dive* into what they're all about!\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XL6nHmf.gif)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**Dolphins are highly intelligent aquatic mammals and are pretty cute too!**\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n## A Home Beneath the Waves\r\n\r\n[Fishy Fam](https://twitter.com/fishyfamNFT) is a community-driven project focused on cleaning up the ocean by assisting charities and hosting IRL events. One of Fishy Fam's main goals is to spread their message far and wide and leave their mark on the NFT space by making a positive impact in the world.\r\n\r\nHolders of Fishy Fam NFTs will gain access to a number of items including:\r\n\r\n- An awesomely adorable profile picture\r\n- Tickets to IRL events\r\n- Exclusive merchandise, and\r\n- $toxic tokens\r\n\r\nMost importantly, holders get to be part of changing the world for the better! Now that sounds like an amazing deal to me! The popularity of Fishy Fam seems to be growing at an explosive rate, and despite only having been around for a couple of weeks, they already have 30,000 people in their Discord. Check it out:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n![](twitter:fishyfamNFT/status/1484274699580420102)\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nNow let's take a gander at some of these lovable Fishy Fam NFTs!\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YhCBl6W.png)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/psZrTqQ.png)\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tA4tJu0.jpg)\r\n\r\n> Fishy Fam NFTs feature some clean and colorful art as well as a number of different traits, meaning that each and every NFT is entirely unique\r\n\r\nFishy Fam is still pretty new with the core team busy gearing up for mint, but despite this fact, their whitelist is already full! As a result, they have already closed the Google Form they had opened in their Discord. You stood a higher chance of getting whitelisted if you are involved in or hold an NFT from one or more of the following communities:\r\n\r\n- [Crypto Mories](https://cryptomories.iwwon.com/home)\r\n- [Alien Frens](https://alienfrens.io/)\r\n- [Deadfellaz](https://www.deadfellaz.io/)\r\n- And so on...\r\n \r\n> You can view the full list of eligible communities in the Fishy Fam [Discord.](https://discord.com/invite/fishyfam) Did you miss the opportunity to fill in the Google Form? No need to worry! Even if you aren't part of any of the abovementioned communities, Fishy Fam will be hosting plenty of giveaways and contests over on their official [Twitter,](https://twitter.com/fishyfamNFT) so if you're lucky enough to win, you should be in line to secure a whitelist spot (or some other prize) without too much fuss.\r\n\r\n## Treasure Map\r\n\r\nThe team over at Fishy Fam has a bunch of really cool stuff planned for the future including world tour in-real-life events, a community wallet, merchandise and collectibles, and, the most important part of all...ocean cleanups and charitable events! Check out the full Roadmap below 👇\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QxFxC6M.png)\r\n\r\n> You can view the Fishy Fam Roadmap in its original form via their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fishyfam)\r\n\r\n## Collaborations With NFT Communities\r\n\r\nFishy Fam really understand the power of community and collaboration. As such, they have created several collaborations with Crypto Mories, Alien Frens, [Gunslingers](https://www.gunslingersnft.com/) and [Cryptoon Goonz.](https://www.cryptoongoonz.com/) Check out one of their more recent collaborations with [Little Lemon Friends:](https://www.littlelemonfriendsnft.com/)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n![](twitter:fishyfamNFT/status/1484217952819982343)\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nFishy Fam has received overwhelmingly positive responses from these collaborations and managed to grow their community in record time. By offering members of existing projects some new forms of utility as well as some incentives to participate, Fishy Fam has developed a winning strategy that has catapulted their project into the stratosphere!\r\n\r\n## Fishtastic Stats\r\n\r\nFishy Fam is currently getting ready for their upcoming mint later this month. With its super cute and fun art style and rapidly growing community, Fishy Fam is set to be a project that could very well set a new standard for the NFT space. Make sure you follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fishyfamNFT) and join their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fishyfam) to so that you can get on their whitelist and be ready to mint one of these sweet little sea monsters.\r\n\r\nThat about does it for today folks.

MSQ recently moved into its Open Beta, meaning you can now sign up for a profile, list your project and check out all the site has to offer. From Monday to Friday we bring you our Discovery of the Day series of articles covering some of our top picks from the world of NFTs, Blockchain gaming and the metaverse! In today's edition we take a look at a truly unique endeavor with an amazing story behind it...this is The Anatomical Project!***\r\n\r\n## Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes\r\n\r\nYou are not just one thing—and no, I don't mean all the roles you fulfill on a daily basis. Indeed, you are made up of billions and billions of tiny parts...atoms, proteins, neurons, a wide variety of intricately interwoven cells and an untold number of other microscopic things. Despite the incomprehensible vastness of the universe and the infinitesimally tiny building blocks that constitute all matter, one of the greatest sources of fascination and consternation is the human body. If you think about it, the mathematical chances of you being who you are is nigh impossible. If the universe is indeed 13.8 billion years old, that means it took about 13.8 billion years for you to come into being. Far out!\r\n\r\nSo what exactly are the odds? Well, according to a 2011 [Tedx Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/mel_robbins_how_to_stop_screwing_yourself_over?language=en) by Mel Robbins, about 1 in 400 *trillion.* However, that can't be right, can it? Because you're here, reading this, so given the way time and the mechanics of infinity work, even that which is close to impossible must inevitably come to be...\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/a4vTeAK.png)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**Is your third eye open yet, anon?** 🌌\r\n    \r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThe matter that constitutes us didn't simply come out of nowhere. Indeed, all that which is here has 'always' been here, and even after we're long gone, those things that once made us who we are will be somewhere else, part of something else. So yeah, when you look up at the stars at night, or even squint your eyes while trying to catch a glimpse of the Sun, the stuff that comprises them is more or less the same that comprises you.\r\n\r\nThe human body is truly a marvel of engineering, or perhaps more accurately, the product of a very long and profound evolutionary path. However, even though we are sentient beings, it's easy to abuse our bodies with alcohol, narcotics, fatty foods, sugar and so on. The sad thing is that a lot of this isn't necessarily conscious or even deliberate, but invariably we put our bodies through a lot of stress. It's important that we take care of our health, both mental and physical, if we are to weather the many challenges that the modern world hurls headlong at us. If we want to remember who and what we are, we sometimes need to give some considered thought to the things that ensure our continued survival in this perilous existence.\r\n\r\n## Meet the Marvelous Melissa!\r\n\r\nThis isn't usually how I start Discoveries of the Day, but because of this project's strong human focus, I think it's important to zoom in on the human being behind it. [Melissa Freund](https://twitter.com/melissa_nft) is a self-taught artist and creator as well as a coloring book author. She is also a mother to a precious daughter and the wife of [Ryan Freund,](https://twitter.com/PoisedMeerkat) an NFT enthusiast and her biggest fan. Melissa is also the winner of the [VeeFriends](https://veefriends.com/) 2021 Pumpkin Carving Contest - I'm not going to try describe this, you can just bear witness to this incredible artistry yourself:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n![](twitter:melissa_nft/status/1464044301764149254)\r\n    \r\n</div>\r\n\r\nMelissa is definitely a believer and advocate of NFTs. In fact, she's actually a 3x resident at [Ethereum Towers,](https://ethereumtowers.com/) an epic project I recently covered which actually led to me finding out about Melissa and her work. Amazing how things work, right?\r\n\r\n> Check out this MSQ Discovery of the Day - [Own Prime Metaverse Real Estate in Ethereum Towers!](https://MSQ.io/blog/own-prime-metaverse-real-estate-in-ethereum-towers)\r\n\r\nSo what I'm really asking is, 'Wen Melissa Freund Art Gallery in Ethereum Towers!?' For real though, I'd love to see this happen. Oh would you look at that? I've talked so much I haven't even gotten around to Melissa's project and artwork yet! Forgive me, but the above exposition is all entirely necessary and important, I assure you. Fear not, for your patience and dedication will be duly rewarded...now!\r\n\r\n## The Colors Within Us\r\n\r\nMelissa is a talented NFT artist and the creator of [The Anatomical Project,](https://theanatomicalproject.com/) an effort that began as a result of something very personal and trying to Melissa and her husband. In her own words:\r\n\r\n> My parenting journey started with the heart. My daughter was born with a rare heart defect & needed open heart surgery at 11 days old. I decided to draw hearts as a way to cope. \r\n\r\nMelissa then decided to take the hearts she was drawing and published a [Coloring Book](https://www.amazon.com/ANATOMICAL-HEARTS-COLORING-Melissa-Freund/dp/1952058015/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=melissa+freund&qid=1637704215&sr=8-1) back in May 2021:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jV6bKMe.jpg)\r\n\r\nA few months later, in September 2021, Melissa created a 100 piece Genesis NFT collection called [Anatomical Hearts.](https://opensea.io/collection/anatomicalhearts) Here's an example of one of these amazing hearts:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/c1W06UE.jpg)\r\n\r\n> Melissa's work features a beautiful cacophony of colors and, as seen here in **[Anatomical Heart #92,](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/28824502245252267217549902857601847351510039266873569823091148231597644316673)** a huge amount of fine detail, unique patterns and intricate line work. Her work ranges in terms of its geometric designs and lucidity, but regardless, her Genesis project never fails to be anything short of visually compelling and stunningly rendered, evoking a strong emotional response from the viewer\r\n\r\nMelissa was so inspired and moved by the overall feedback she received (as well as the many relationships she formed) that she decided to extend her collection in an effort to further support the medical community...\r\n\r\n## A True Body of Work\r\n\r\nYes indeed, the Anatomical Project includes the following different body parts that Melissa hopes will help others to connect her art with their own personal journeys:\r\n\r\n- Hearts 100/100 (**Completed**)\r\n- Brains 23/100\r\n- Kidneys 22/100\r\n- Livers 23/100\r\n- Lungs 24/100\r\n- Eyes 2/100\r\n- Skulls 2/100\r\n- Uteruses 2/100\r\n- DNA 2/100\r\n\r\n> ***Disclaimer**: The above information is accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check The Anatomical Project's [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/theanatomicalproject) page for the latest details*\r\n\r\nAs it appears, the final collection (at least at this point) will consist of no less than 900 pieces of original art by Melissa herself. She's making sterling progress but has some way to go until the collection is complete, so you'll definitely want to get your piece now while she's still hard at work.\r\n\r\nLet's take a brief look at some of the current pieces from The Anatomical Project:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0oR4eYQ.jpg)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**How about this super intricate pair of lungs?**\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kTvnKbJ.jpg)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**Another imaginative but tasteful use of color by Melissa in this liver**\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0PtXQ3n.jpg)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**I adore the colors in these kidneys - almost looks edible!**\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n## Body and Soul Stats\r\n    \r\nSo as you can see, Melissa's work is truly visionary, meaningful and lovingly rendered. There's a joyful musicality within her pieces, and I can't help but think about bands like [Tears for Fears,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_for_Fears) [Tool](https://toolband.com/) and even [Alice in Chains](https://aliceinchains.com/) when I look at these pieces (I'm sure you'll relate your own worldviews and stories to these pieces, but these are just some of mine).\r\n\r\nI think I could very well go on about Melissa's work for ages, but the main point to keep in mind here is that, regardless of where you are in the world, because we are all made of the same stuff and share similar experiences, we can connect with Melissa's work because it is so recognizable and characteristically **human.**\r\n\r\nAnd now for some OpenSea stats!\r\n\r\n_Please Note: Stats are accurate at the time of writing, but be sure to check the original source for the most current information._\r\n\r\n### [Anatomical Hearts](https://opensea.io/collection/anatomicalhearts)\r\n\r\n* **Available Items** - 100\r\n* **Owners** - 67\r\n\r\n### [The Anatomical Project](https://opensea.io/collection/theanatomicalproject)\r\n\r\n* **Available Items** - 122\r\n* **Owners** - 56\r\n\r\nPlease also note the following disclaimer as per the Anatomical Project website:\r\n\r\n> Only limited personal non-commercial use and resale rights in the NFT are granted, and you have no right to license, commercially exploit, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, publicly perform, or publicly display the NFT or the music or the artwork therein.

You definitely want to follow The Anatomical Project on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nft_hearts) and join Melissa's [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yJSuTWhfzx) so you can get all the latest news and updates as and when they become available.\r\n\r\nSo what do you think of Melissa and The Anatomical Project?

Today we take a closer look at some interstellar travelers who have found a new home on Earth...This is Ethalien!***\r\n\r\n## Aliens...Exist!?\r\n\r\nIn the last few decades there have been numerous discoveries that suggest life exists beyond the familiar atmosphere of our beloved planet Earth. There have been several 'sightings' where UFOs have been spotted hovering or careening across our skies, and who can forget all the controversy surrounding the [Roswell Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell_incident) of 1947? Regardless of your thoughts and theories on these strange occurrences, there are other, shall we say, more 'scientific' pieces of evidence that would incontrovertibly prove the existence of extraterrestrial life in some form or another:\r\n\r\n- [Alien bacteria might live in the clouds of Venus](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/14/912619891/a-possible-sign-of-life-right-next-door-to-earth-on-venus?t=1643031608627)\r\n- [Oumuamua could still be an alien artifact](https://www.livescience.com/oumuamua-interstellar-hydrogen-or-aliens.html)\r\n- [This blurry photo of an 'alien'](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/man-snaps-naked-alien-bulbous-25855895) (OK, maybe not *this* one)\r\n\r\nAlthough these are all very intriguing, we have yet to see indisputable proof that aliens *actually* exist. Time and time again, conspiracy theories, UFO sightings and alleged scientific research have been debunked. Despite this, maybe, just maybe, 2022 will be the year aliens finally make contact...\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tpEev9m.png)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**Oumuamua, a mysterious, interstellar object that drifted into our solar system about two years ago**\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nHowever, we have seen proof of aliens living in the metaverse—[The Alien Boys,](https://www.thealienboy.com/) [Lonely Alien Space Club,](https://lonelyaliens.com/) and [Alien Frens](https://alienfrens.io/) are just a handful of the otherworldly visitors currently dwelling within our solar system. These aren't the only extraterrestrials around though—as it turns out, there's a new species in town, and they're infiltrating and living on our very own blue orb, Earth! Today, we bring you [Ethalien!](https://www.ethaliens.com/) 👽\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RuWyBWP.png)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n**Lonely Alien Space Club, Alien Frens & The Alien Boys**\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n## When Worlds Collide\r\n\r\n[Ethalien](https://www.ethaliens.com/) is a collection of 7,500 NFTs that fled their home planet, Zerkton, and now inhabit Earth. The focus of the project is to facilitate a strong community and become a major player within the realms of Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming. However, these funky Ethaliens are just the tip of the iceberg in the wider Ethalien Metaverse.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eFZjQW2.png)\r\n\r\n### Baby Ethaliens\r\n\r\nThroughout December and January, if you held two Ethaliens and 300 $STAR, you were eligible to breed them in order to create a Baby Ethalien! These cute little guys come with plenty of utility and give you access to exciting features such as:\r\n\r\n- The Web3 Starcade and Play-to-Earn Adventure Quests\r\n- The ability to earn Star Dust, $STAR & limited-edition Ethalien NFTs\r\n- Access to the exclusive Alpha Lounge\r\n- The opportunity to enter $STAR raffles\r\n- Exclusive Baby Ethalien Merchandise, and\r\n- Future Whitelist Opportunities\r\n\r\nWow! Now that really is a ton of utility! Now let's take a look at some of these sweet Baby Ethaliens 👀\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SADP4On.png)\r\n\r\n### $STAR Token, STAR Shop & STARcade\r\n\r\n$STAR is an ERC-20 utility token that fuels the Ethalien Ecosystem. It's capped at a total of 69,420,000 *(ba dum tss!)* Each Ethalien generates 5 $STAR per day for a total of 5 years. *That's what I call long-term utility!* The token can be used throughout every collection (Ethalien, Baby Ethalien & Ethalien VOX) as well as the STAR Shop, STAR Auction and Starcade.\r\n\r\n* The [$STAR shop](https://www.ethaliens.com/shop) is a place where you can purchase the $STAR badge, Twitter and Discord Banners, NFTs and much more\r\n* The [Starcade](https://www.ethaliens.com/starcade) is simple—spend $STAR to play $STARCADE games for the chance to win more $STAR\r\n\r\n### Ethalien VOX\r\n\r\nLast but not least, let's talk about the latest addition to the Ethalien Metaverse...**Ethalien VOX**!
